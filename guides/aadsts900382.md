# AADSTS900382: Confidential Client isn't supported in Cross Cloud request.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Error Code: AADSTS900382 - Confidential Client isn't supported in Cross Cloud request

### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Verify Environment**: Ensure that the identity provider, application, and authentication flows involved are compatible.
  
2. **Check Request Configuration**: Review the settings and parameters used in the authentication request for any misconfigurations related to confidentiality.

3. **Review Error Logs**: Look at the error logs or traces for more detailed information on the error to pinpoint the cause.

### Common Issues that Cause this Error:
1. **Incorrect Client Configuration**: The client might be misconfigured as a confidential client when it should be a public client or vice versa.
  
2. **Cross Cloud Request Misconfiguration**: Requesting authentication across different cloud providers can lead to this error if not handled correctly.

3. **Authentication Flow Mismatch**: The authentication flow being used may not align with the capabilities of the involved entities (client, server, etc.).

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Update Client Configuration**: Ensure that the client configuration in the identity provider (Azure AD, Okta, etc.) matches the intended confidentiality requirements.
  
2. **Review Cross Cloud Request Setup**: if relevant, ensure that the authentication request follows the guidelines for cross-platform or cross-cloud requests.

3. **Adjust Authentication Flow**: If possible, modify the authentication flow to align with the supported configurations for the involved entities.
  
4. **Check Permissions**: Verify that the client has the necessary permissions for the requested operation across clouds.

### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- **Identity Provider Support**: Some identity providers may not support certain client configurations or cross-cloud requests, so check the documentation of the specific provider being used.
  
- **Error Interpretation**: Understanding the exact cause of the error might require detailed examination of logs or contacting support for further help.

### Documentation for Guidance:
- **Microsoft Azure AD Documentation**: Visit [Azure AD documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/) for specific guides on configuring clients and dealing with various authentication errors.

- **Okta Developer Documentation**: For Okta-specific issues, refer to the [Okta Developer Docs](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/errors/) for detailed information and troubleshooting steps.

By following the outlined diagnostic steps and resolution strategies, you should be able to address the AADSTS900382 error related to a confidential client not being supported in a cross-cloud request effectively.

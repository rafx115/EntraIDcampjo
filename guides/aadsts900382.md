# AADSTS900382: Confidential Client isn't supported in Cross Cloud request.


## Troubleshooting Steps
## Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS900382

### Error Code Description
The error code **AADSTS900382** indicates that the application being used as a **Confidential Client** is attempting to make a request across different Azure Active Directory (AAD) clouds, which is not supported. A **Confidential Client** refers to applications that have the ability to securely keep credentials safe, such as web apps or backend services.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Check Cloud Environment**: Verify which Azure Active Directory cloud the application is configured to use (e.g., Azure AD Global, Azure AD China, Azure AD Germany, etc.). Ensure it matches the Azure cloud environment where the user or resource resides.

2. **Review Application Configuration**: Look at the application's Azure registration in the Azure portal. Confirm that it is set up correctly and that the client credentials are valid.

3. **Examine Token Request**: Review the token request being made by the application. Ensure that the request is pointing to the correct endpoint. 

### Common Issues That Cause This Error
- **Cross-Cloud Requests**: The application is configured to point to a different Azure cloud than where the resource or user is located.
- **Incorrect Client Configuration**: The application's Azure AD registration may not have the required permissions to access the resources within the specified cloud.
- **Credential Issues**: The credentials used (client secret or certificate) may not be valid or properly configured.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Confirm Azure Cloud Environment**:
   - Navigate to the Azure portal.
   - Check the Azure Active Directory section to verify which cloud environment is set for your organization.
   - Confirm the application and resources are within the same cloud.

2. **Validate Application Registration**:
   - Go to the **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations** in the Azure portal.
   - Select your application and check the **Authentication** section to ensure the redirect URIs are correct.
   - Verify that the application has the correct API permissions.

3. **Check Token Request**:
   - Ensure the access token request is targeting the correct AAD instance URL (for example, `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token`).
   - Make sure the tenant ID in the URL matches the tenant where the resource is located.

4. **Update Client Credentials**:
   - If using a client secret, generate a new client secret and update the application configuration.
   - If using a certificate, ensure that the certificate is valid and correctly installed in Azure.

5. **Check Application Authorization Flow**:
   - Verify that the specific authorization flow being used (e.g., client credentials flow, authorization code flow) is appropriate for the application type and matches what's configured in Azure AD.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that you are testing from appropriate network environments since network restrictions may also cause issues with authentication.
- Review for any service outages or issues reported in the Azure status page that might affect authentication services.

### Advice for Data Collection
If the issue persists after following the troubleshooting steps, consider collecting the following data for further analysis:
- **Event Viewer Logs**: Check the event logs for authentication-related events. Look for errors in the "Application" logs related to your application.
- **Network Trace (NetTrace)**: Use tools like `netsh trace` to capture network traffic when attempting to authenticate and identify request failures.
- **Fiddler**: This tool can capture HTTP/S traffic; ensure to enable HTTPS decryption to analyze the requests made to Azure AD, particularly the token request flow.

By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the issue related to the AADSTS900382 error code effectively. If issues persist after following these guidelines, consider reaching out to Microsoft Support for further assistance.

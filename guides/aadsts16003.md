## Troubleshooting Steps

Here is a detailed troubleshooting guide for the AADSTS16003 error code with the
description "SsoUserAccountNotFoundInResourceTenant":

### Initial Diagnostic Steps:

1. **Verify User Account:** Ensure that the user account accessing the resource
   has been explicitly added to the tenant in Azure Active Directory.
2. **Check Permissions:** Review the permissions and roles assigned to the user
   within the tenant and the resource.
3. **Confirm Application Configuration:** Verify that the application
   configuration (e.g., app registration settings, permissions) is correctly set
   up in Azure portal.

### Common Issues Causing the Error:

1. **Incorrect User Assignment:** The user account may not have been correctly
   added or assigned to the tenant.
2. **Missing Permissions:** The user may lack the necessary permissions to
   access the resource.
3. **Misconfigured Application:** Issues in the application setup, such as
   incorrect permissions or configurations, can also lead to this error.

### Step-by-step Resolution Strategies:

1. **Manually Add User to Tenant:**

   - Go to the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to Azure Active Directory > Users and groups.
   - Select the user and add them to the tenant if they are not already added.

2. **Review Permissions and Roles:**

   - Check the permissions and roles assigned to the user in Azure Active
     Directory and the resource's access control settings.
   - Ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to access the resource.

3. **Update Application Configuration:**
   - In the Azure portal, review the application registration settings for the
     affected application.
   - Verify that the required permissions and configurations are correctly set
     up.

### Additional Notes or Considerations:

- **Group Membership:** If users are managed through groups, ensure that the
  user is a member of the appropriate group that has access to the resource.
- **Conditional Access Policies:** Check if any Conditional Access policies are
  restricting the user's access to the resource.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Confirm the Error Message:** Double-check the exact error code and description to ensure it matches AADSTS90130.
2. **Identify Application Type:** Determine whether the application is intended for a specific organization, a multi-tenant application, or only for personal Microsoft accounts.
3. **Review Authentication Request:** Inspect the authentication request URL to see if it is using the /common or /consumer endpoints.
4. **Check User Context:** Identify if the user trying to authenticate belongs to a tenant (organization) or is a personal account.

### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **Using Incorrect Endpoint:** Attempting to authenticate using the /common or /consumer endpoints for an application that is intended for organizational use only.
2. **Application Configuration Mismatch:** The application may be configured incorrectly in Azure AD to allow only organizational sign-ins.
3. **Token Request Issues:** Issues with how tokens are being requested or returned by the application.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Update the Authentication Request Endpoint:**
   - For organizational applications, replace the endpoint in your authentication request URL from:
     ```
     https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize
     ```
     to:
     ```
     https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize
     ```
   - Alternatively, use the `/organizations` endpoint:
     ```
     https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations/oauth2/v2.0/authorize
     ```

2. **Check Application Settings in Azure AD:**
   - Navigate to the Azure Portal.
   - Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations**.
   - Find your application and ensure that it is set up to accept sign-ins from the correct types of users (either organizational or personal).

3. **Modify App Registration Permissions:**
   - Ensure that APIs required for the application are properly set in the application registration.
   - Adjust permissions to make sure it aligns with intended users (e.g., for organizational users, select "Accounts in this organizational directory only").

4. **Review API and Redirect URI Configuration:**
   - Confirm that the redirect URIs defined in the app registration are correct and that they match the requests made by your application.

5. **Test the Configuration:**
   - After making adjustments, attempt to authenticate again using the updated endpoint and application configuration.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Testing:** Itâ€™s a good practice to test authentication with both a tenant-specific account and a personal account (if applicable) to ensure that the application behaves as expected for both scenarios.
- **Endpoint Usage:** Remember that the /common endpoint is generally used for applications that are intended for a wide array of users, including both personal and organizational accounts. Ensure that your application's intended audience matches the endpoint being utilized.

### Advice for Data Collection

- Collect logs from the application trying to authenticate, including request URLs, HTTP response codes, and error messages returned.
- Use tools like Fiddler or browser developer tools to capture detailed information about the authentication requests and responses.
- If applicable, gather information about the user accounts and any specific tenant settings that may influence authentication behavior.

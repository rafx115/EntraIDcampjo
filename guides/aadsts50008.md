# AADSTS50008: InvalidSamlToken - SAML assertion is missing or misconfigured in the token. Contact your federation provider.


## Troubleshooting Steps
## Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS50008: InvalidSamlToken

### Overview
The error code AADSTS50008 indicates that there is a problem with the SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) token, specifically that it is either missing required assertions or the configuration is incorrect. This error typically occurs in scenarios involving Single Sign-On (SSO) using SAML with Azure Active Directory.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Verify the Error Context**: Check the application's logs and identify when the error occurs. Note any patterns or specific actions that lead to the error.
2. **Reproduce the Issue**: Try to reproduce the error consistently by following the same steps that led to the initial error.
3. **Check User Credentials**: Ensure that the user credentials being used for authentication are correct and that the user is part of the required group/system.
4. **Check Logs**: 
   - Look at the Azure Active Directory sign-in logs.
   - Look at the application’s logs (if available) for any further details related to the SAML token.

### Common Issues that Cause this Error
1. **SAML Assertion Missing Required Claims**: The SAML assertion sent to Azure AD doesn't contain necessary attributes/claims.
2. **Incorrect Configuration on Identity Provider (IdP)**: The IdP may be misconfigured, causing it to generate an invalid SAML assertion.
3. **SAML Token Expired**: The SAML token may be expired before it's sent, leading Azure AD to reject it.
4. **Clock Skew**: The system clocks on the IdP and Azure AD may not be synchronized, causing issues with token validity periods.
5. **Signature Issues**: The SAML response may not be properly signed or could be using an incorrect signing certificate. 

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Review SAML Token Content**:
   - Use SAML tracer tools, such as browser extensions like "SAML-tracer", to capture the SAML token.
   - Check the SAML assertion for required claims, including `<saml:NameID>` and any custom claims expected by Azure AD.
  
2. **Review Identity Provider Configuration**:
   - Log in to your Identity Provider's management portal and verify the SAML settings, making sure that it’s configured to send all necessary attributes.
   - Confirm that the SAML assertion settings (such as audience, issuer, and recipient) match those expected by Azure AD.

3. **Check Clock Skew**:
   - Ensure that both the IdP and Azure AD servers are synchronized with NTP (Network Time Protocol).
   - Look for any clock skew settings in the IdP that might cause the SAML token to appear expired.

4. **Validate Signing Certificate**:
   - Make sure the signing certificate used by the IDP is valid, not expired, and corresponds with what Azure AD is configured to accept.
   - Update the certificate in both the IdP and Azure AD if changes have occurred.

5. **SAML Token Expiration**:
   - Verify the 'NotBefore' and 'NotOnOrAfter' attributes in the SAML token to ensure they are within an acceptable range.

6. **Test and Validate**:
   - After making any changes, test the SSO login process again and monitor the response and the outcomes.
   - Repeat the diagnosing steps to ensure the issue is resolved.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- If using third-party Identity Providers (like ADFS, Okta), check their documentation for specific configuration guidelines ensuring SAML assertions are properly set up.
- Ensure you have the correct permissions to modify configurations on the IdP and Azure AD.
- Be aware of any recent changes or upgrades in your IdP or Azure AD configuration that may have inadvertently caused this issue.

### Testing Documentation Accessibility
To ensure that documentation is reachable:
- Open the provided links in a web browser and verify you can access the content.
- Check network configurations and firewall settings that may be causing access issues.

### Advice for Data Collection
- Collect all logs related to the authentication attempt, both from Azure AD and the Identity Provider.
- Screenshot or save the SAML token for inspection.
- Document the time and context of the issues, including the user IDs affected and any changes made before the incident occurred.
- Gather system configurations for both the IdP and Azure AD settings that relate to the application and SSO settings. 

By following the steps outlined in this troubleshooting guide, you should be able to diagnose and resolve issues related to the AADSTS50008 error code effectively.

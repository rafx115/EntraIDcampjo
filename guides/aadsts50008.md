# AADSTS50008: InvalidSamlToken - SAML assertion is missing or misconfigured in the token. Contact your federation provider.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The error code **AADSTS50008** indicates an issue with the SAML assertion in your authentication process, typically pointing to a misconfigured or missing SAML token. Here’s a detailed troubleshooting guide to help you resolve this error effectively.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50008

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify the Affected Users**: Determine if the error is localized to a specific user, a group of users, or an entire application/service.
2. **Check the Timing of the Issue**: Assess whether this is a recurring problem or a one-time event after recent changes.
3. **Review Recent Changes**: Look for any updates or changes in the identity provider (IdP) configuration, if using a federation service, or application settings that could impact authentication.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **Missing or Misconfigured SAML Assertion**:
   - The SAML assertion may not be generated properly by the IdP.
   - The SAML token could be empty or lack necessary attributes.
2. **Incorrectly Configured Claims**:
   - Misconfigurations in the claims mapping from the IdP to the Azure AD.
3. **Certificate Issues**:
   - The signing certificate used by the IdP may not be correctly trusted by Azure AD.
4. **Expired Tokens**:
   - Tokens may have expired or not been properly renewed.
5. **Incorrect Audience URIs**:
   - The audience URI in the SAML assertion may not match the expected value in Azure AD.
6. **Time Skew**:
   - There can be time differences between the IdP and Azure AD, leading to token rejection.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Verify SAML Configuration**:
   - Ensure the SAML application settings in Azure AD are correct (e.g., Entity ID, Reply URL).
   - Confirm that the IdP is configured to send the correct audience and redirect URIs.

2. **Check SAML Assertion**:
   - Use a tool like Fiddler or SAML-tracer (Browser Extension) to inspect the SAML response to verify its attributes and structure.
   - Look for attributes like `NameID`, `IssueInstant`, `Audience`, and required claims.

3. **Ensure Valid Certificates**:
   - Verify that the certificate used to sign the SAML token is valid and has not expired.
   - Ensure Azure AD trusts the IdP's signing certificate.

4. **Inspect Claims Mapping**:
   - Check if the necessary claims are being sent from the IdP and properly mapped in Azure AD.
   - Verify attribute values received from the IdP.

5. **Validate Date and Time Settings**: 
   - Ensure that the time is synchronized on both the IdP and the Azure AD.

6. **Review IdP Logs**:
   - Access the IdP’s logs to look for errors related to SAML assertions.
   - Check if the IdP is generating the SAML assertions correctly.

7. **Test with Alternate Browser/Client**:
   - Test accessing the application from another browser or client to rule out client-side issues.

8. **Contact Federation Provider**: 
   - If you are unable to resolve the issue, reach out to your IdP support for assistance. Provide them with details of the SAML assertion you captured.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that any recent updates to the IdP or Azure settings are fully tested before rolling them out.
- Monitor log files and endpoints for anomalies during authentication attempts.

#### Documentation Where Steps Can Be Found
- Azure AD SAML Authentication Documentation: [Azure AD SAML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-saml-protocol)
- IdP Specific Configuration Documentation: Check the documentation for your IdP as implementations can vary (e.g., ADFS, Okta).

#### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**: For Windows applications, check the Event Viewer logs for any pertinent logs or error messages related to the authentication processes.
- **Network Capture (NetTrace)**: Use NetTrace to capture network traffic if you suspect issues at the network layer.
- **Fiddler**: Capture HTTP/S traffic using Fiddler to see the SAML token being sent to Azure AD. Look for specific request and response messages that include the SAML assertions.

By following this guide, you should be better equipped to diagnose and address the AADSTS50008 error related to SAML tokens. If these steps do not resolve the issue, consider escalating to your application's support team or your IdP’s support resources for further assistance.

Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS650054: "The application asked for
permissions to access a resource that has been removed or is no longer
available. Make sure that all resources the app is calling are present in the
tenant you're operating in."

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:** 

1. **Verify Permission Request:** Check the specific permissions the application

   is requesting and ensure the resource is still available in the tenant.

2. **Review App Configuration:** Check the configuration settings of the

   application in Azure AD to verify the registered resource, required
   permissions, and manifest settings.

3. **Check Resource Availability:** Validate if the resource the app is trying

   to access is still present and accessible in the tenant environment.

**Common Issues that Cause This Error:** 

1. **Resource Deletion:** The resource that the application is trying to access

   has been deleted or is no longer available in the tenant.

2. **Incorrect Permissions:** The app might be requesting permissions that are

   no longer valid or needed for the resource.

3. **Misconfigured App Registration:** Incorrect configuration of the Azure AD

   app registration, such as missing or incorrect resource URIs, permissions, or
   redirect URIs.

**Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:** 

1. **Check Resource Availability:** 

   * Verify that the resource the app is calling, such as an API or service, is

     still present and accessible in the tenant.
   * If the resource has been deleted, the application will need to be updated

     to target an alternative resource or service.

2. **Update App Permissions:** 

   * Review the permissions requested by the application and ensure they are

     accurate and still necessary for the resource.
   * Update the app registration in Azure AD to request the appropriate

     permissions for the available resources.

3. **Verify App Configuration:**    * Check the Azure AD app registration 
settings, including the redirect URIs,

     permissions, and resource URIs.
   * Update the app manifest if necessary to ensure it aligns with the current

     resources and permissions.

**Additional Notes or Considerations:**


* **Communication:** Ensure proper communication between the application

  developers and Azure AD administrators to align on the required permissions
  and resources.


* **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring mechanisms to track changes in resources

  or permissions that could potentially impact the application's functionality.


* **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing after making any changes to the app

  registration to ensure the application can access the required resources
  successfully.

By following these diagnostic steps, identifying common issues, and implementing
the resolution strategies, you should be able to address the error code
AADSTS650054 effectively and ensure that the application can access the required
resources in the tenant environment.

# AADSTS650054: The application asked for permissions to access a resource that has been removed or is no longer available. Make sure that all resources the app is calling are present in the tenant you're operating in.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Here’s a detailed troubleshooting guide to address the AADSTS650054 error which indicates that the application is requesting permissions for resources that are no longer available.

### AADSTS650054 Troubleshooting Guide

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Understand the Context**:
   - Note the specific operations that lead to this error.
   - Identify which application is being used and under what circumstances the error occurs (e.g. login attempts, API calls).

2. **Check the Application Registration**:
   - Go to the Azure portal and navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations**.
   - Make sure the application has been registered and is enabled.

3. **Review the Permissions**:
   - Within the application registration, check **API permissions**.
   - Ensure that the requested permissions are still valid and properly configured.

4. **Tenant Context**:
   - Confirm that the resources (e.g., APIs, databases) are available in the tenant you are operating in. If they have been removed or renamed, this might lead to this error.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error
- **Removed Resources**: The API or resource the application is trying to access has been deleted or is no longer available.
  
- **Misconfigured Permissions**: The permissions granted to the application do not match what is requested in the token or there is a mismatch in what is configured in Azure.

- **Resource Availability**: Resources from other tenants that are being accessed are no longer shared or have restricted access.

- **Scopes and Consent**: The application may be requesting scopes/permissions that have not been consented to or are no longer available.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Validate Resource Availability**:
   - Check if the resource that the application is trying to access exists in your tenant. If it’s external, ensure that it is shared correctly.

2. **Review and Update API Permissions**:
   - Go to the application's registration in Azure portal.
   - Navigate to **API permissions** and check the granted permissions. Remove any that are no longer applicable.
   - If specific resources are needed, ensure that they are added back as required permissions.
   - Once modified, re-grant admin consent if necessary.

3. **Review Application Code**:
   - If applicable, check the application code for hard-coded resource identifiers or scopes that might be outdated.
   - Ensure that any changes to API endpoints or permissions in the application are reflected in the Azure settings.

4. **Consent Framework**:
   - Ensure that any user or admin consent that must be granted for permissions is obtained. You may need to generate a new consent URL and have users re-consent.
  
5. **Testing**:
   - Try to obtain a new token and make requests to the API again after making these changes.

6. **Consult Logs and Tracing**:
   - Enable logging to gather information about your app’s interactions with Azure AD. 

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **User Roles**: Ensure that the user trying to access the resources has sufficient permissions/roles assigned within Azure AD.
- **Environment Isolation**: Consider if you are testing in a different Azure AD environment than expected, possibly a staging or development tenant.

#### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**: If the issue involves desktop applications, check the Event Viewer on the client machine for any related application errors or logs under **Application** or **Security** logs.
- **Network Tracing**: Use **Fiddler** or similar tools to capture HTTP traffic to identify incoming/outgoing requests to Azure AD. This can help in seeing what specific requests are failing.
- **Performance Traces**: Use `Nettrac` to get more in-depth analysis of network calls, especially if you suspect network-related issues or timeouts.

By following these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the AADSTS650054 error effectively.

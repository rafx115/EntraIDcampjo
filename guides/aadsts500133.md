# AADSTS500133: Assertion isn't within its valid time range. Ensure that the access token isn't expired before using it for user assertion, or request a new token. Current time: {curTime}, expiry time of assertion {expTime}. Assertion is invalid because of various reasons:The token issuer doesn't match the API version within its valid time rangeExpiredMalformedRefresh token in the assertion isn't a primary refresh token


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide for addressing the error code AADSTS500133, which indicates that an authentication assertion is not within its valid time range.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS500133

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Review Error Message**: Examine the complete error message, paying special attention to the `current time` and `expiry time` values. Note any discrepancies between the two.
2. **Check Time Settings**: Ensure that the system clock on your client device and server is synchronized with a reliable time source (like an NTP server).
3. **Validate Token**: If you have an access token or refresh token, check its validity and confirm whether it has expired.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **Expired Tokens**: The access token has been used after its expiry.
2. **Mismatched Time**: The current system time is incorrect or the time zone is set incorrectly.
3. **Improper Token Issuance**: The token issuer is different from the expected issuer.
4. **Token Malformation**: The access or refresh token is malformed.
5. **Use of Non-primary Refresh Tokens**: Non-primary refresh tokens may lead to this error.
6. **Version Mismatch**: The API version being used does not match the token issuer’s expected API version.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Synchronize System Time**:
   - Ensure that the clients and servers are synchronized with an NTP server.
   - Check and correct the time zone settings.

2. **Check Token Expiry**:
   - Inspect the expiry date of the access token and compare it with the current timestamp.
   - If expired, request a new access token using a valid refresh token or through login credentials.

3. **Verify Token Integrity**:
   - Use tools like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to decode the JWT and check its claims, validity period, and issuer.
   - Ensure the `iss` (issuer) claim matches the expected issuer.

4. **Token Request**: 
   - If tokens are expiring too quickly, review the token lifetimes in your application’s configuration and increase them if necessary.

5. **Use Primary Refresh Tokens**:
   - Ensure that you are using the primary refresh tokens when requesting new access tokens.

6. **API Versioning**:
   - Confirm that the API versions referenced in your application match those supported by the token issuer.

7. **Test in Different Environments**:
   - Ideally, test the authentication flow in a controlled environment or using different user accounts to rule out account-specific issues.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Check for Other Error Codes**: If AADSTS500133 is encountered, it’s useful to look for other related error codes that may indicate underlining issues.
- **Application Configuration**: Review the configuration settings for Azure AD B2C, app registrations, and permissions within the Azure portal.
- **Error Logs**: Continuously prototype and log error occurrences to gain insight into patterns and frequency.

- [Proper Token Handling Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-configuration-tokens)

#### Advice for Data Collection
If the issue persists:
- **Event Viewer Logs**: Check the Event Viewer on Windows for any related log entries (specifically in Application and Security logs).
- **Network Tracing**: Use [NetTrace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-graph-api) or any HTTP debugging tool.
- **Fiddler**: Use Fiddler to capture the network traffic and request/response headers during authentication operations to look for discrepancies in the responses.

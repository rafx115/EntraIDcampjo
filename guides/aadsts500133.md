# AADSTS500133: Assertion isn't within its valid time range. Ensure that the access token isn't expired before using it for user assertion, or request a new token. Current time: {curTime}, expiry time of assertion {expTime}. Assertion is invalid because of various reasons:The token issuer doesn't match the API version within its valid time rangeExpiredMalformedRefresh token in the assertion isn't a primary refresh token


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide for the AADSTS500133 error code, which indicates that the provided assertion is not within its valid time range. This guide includes initial diagnostics, common issues, resolution strategies, additional notes, documentation links, and advice for data collection.

## Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS500133

### **Initial Diagnostic Steps**
1. **Check Current Time:** Confirm the current time on the system making the request. Ensure the system clock is accurate and synchronized with an NTP server.
2. **Check Expiry Time:** Review the expiry time of the assertion being used. This is often included in the token details and should be checked against the current system time.
3. **Token Validation:** If you have access to the token, decode it using a JWT decoder to check its claims, including the `exp` claim (expiry time).
4. **Identify API Version:** Determine whether the API version aligns with the token issuer. Ensure that your application and the Azure Active Directory setup are compatible.

### **Common Issues That Cause This Error**
1. **Clock Skew:** The server and client clocks are not synchronized, leading to mismatched timestamps.
2. **Expired Tokens:** The access token or refresh token has expired.
3. **Malformed Tokens:** The token structure is incorrect, which may include invalid signatures or incorrect claims.
4. **Incorrect Token Issuer:** The token being used has been issued by a different Azure AD tenant or is not valid for the particular API requested.
5. **Non-primary Refresh Token:** An attempt to use a refresh token that isn’t primary, leading to failure in renewing tokens.

### **Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies**
1. **Time Synchronization:**
   - Ensure that the system’s date and time synchronization is working correctly. Use NTP services to ensure clock accuracy.
   - Example command to adjust time on Linux:
     ```bash
     sudo ntpdate -u pool.ntp.org
     ```

2. **Token Refresh:**
   - If the access token has expired, request a new access token using the refresh token or prompt the user to log in again.
   - Ensure that the refresh token used is the primary refresh token.

3. **Review Token Structure:**
   - Use tools like JWT.io to decode the token and inspect the claims.
   - Verify that the `exp` claim is valid and reflects the expected expiry time.
   - If it indicates an issue (like malformed), re-issue the token through the authentication flow.

4. **Verify API Compatibility:**
   - Ensure that the API being called is compatible with the version of the token issued. Check the scopes and permissions granted for the application registered in Azure AD.

5. **Check Issuer:**
   - Ensure that the token is issued by the correct tenant and intended for the correct audience. Cross-check the `iss` and `aud` claims in the token.

### **Additional Notes or Considerations**
- Ensure that any third-party libraries used for authentication are up to date to avoid issues with token handling.
- Review application registration in the Azure portal to identify any configuration changes that may have led to token issues.

### **Documentation Where Steps Can Be Found for Guidance**
1. Azure AD Token Reference: [Azure Active Directory tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens)
2. JWT Tokens Overview: [Understanding JWT Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction/)
3. OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow: [Authorization code flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow)

### **Test the Documentation is Reachable**
- Verify that Azure documentation is accessible by visiting the provided links and ensuring no network issues are preventing access.

### **Advice for Data Collection**
- Collect logs detailing the requests when the error occurs, including timestamps, request parameters, and the full token (if safe).
- Gather details about user accounts, permissions, and application configurations to assist in identifying the root cause and any potential misconfigurations.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS7000112

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check Application Status:**
   - Verify if the application is registered in Azure AD and check its status in the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to the Azure Active Directory portal: [Azure AD Portal](https://aad.portal.azure.com).
   - Go to **App registrations** and find the application. 

2. **Review the Error Message:**
   - Collect the full error message and additional details in the response payload if available.
   - Often you might see an explicit mention of which application is causing the issue.

3. **Identify User Context:**
   - Determine which user or service principal is trying to authenticate and under what context (e.g., user login, service access).

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **Application Disabled:**
   - The application may have been disabled intentionally or accidentally by an administrator.

2. **Permissions:**
   - Lack of proper permissions or consent to the application from the user or administrators.

3. **Tenant Restrictions:**
   - The application could be subject to tenant policies that restrict its use.

4. **Expired Credentials:**
   - If the application uses a secret or certificate for authentication, ensure it has not expired.

#### Step-by-step Resolution Strategies

1. **Enable the Application:**
   - Navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations.
   - Find your application and click on it.
   - Check the application's settings, and ensure it is not disabled.
   - If it is disabled, re-enable it.

2. **Verify Application Permissions:**
   - Check the **API Permissions** section.
   - Ensure the application has the required permissions and that those permissions have been granted admin consent where necessary.

3. **Review Roles and Assignments:**
   - Ensure that the user or service principal attempting to authenticate is assigned the correct roles or permissions to access the application.
   - Navigate to **Enterprise applications**, find your app, and ensure appropriate user assignments.

4. **Consult Azure AD Logs:**
   - Check the sign-in logs in Azure AD for more detailed information on why the authentication attempt may have failed.

5. **Check Expired Credentials:**
   - If the application uses secrets or certificates, verify that these have not expired and are correctly configured.

6. **Contact Admin:**
   - If you do not have sufficient permissions to make the above changes, consult your Azure AD administrator for assistance.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Understand Tenant Policies:** Different Azure AD tenants can have different policies regarding how applications can be registered and used. Make sure you understand any specific organizational policies affecting the application.
  
- **Multiple Tenants:** If your application accesses multiple tenants, ensure it is registered and enabled in all necessary tenants.

2. **Network Traces:**
   - Use **Microsoft Network Monitor** or **Wireshark** to capture network packets during the authentication attempt, focusing on any relevant responses from Azure AD.

3. **Fiddler:**

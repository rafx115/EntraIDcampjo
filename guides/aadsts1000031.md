#### Common Issues That Cause the Error

1. **User Permissions**:
   - The user may not have been granted proper permissions to access the app.

2. **Application Configuration**:
   - The application may not be correctly configured in AAD, such as incorrect redirect URIs or API permissions.

3. **License Issues**:
   - The user may not have the required Azure subscription or licenses needed to access the application.

4. **Conditional Access Policies**:
   - If any conditional access policies are applied (e.g., MFA requirements, location-based access), they may prevent the user from accessing the application.

5. **Application Status**:
   - The application might be disabled or its operational status may be set to “not accessible.”

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify User Permissions**:
   - Go to the Azure portal and navigate to Azure Active Directory > Users > [Select the User] > Assigned Roles. Make sure the user has the correct role assigned to access the app.

2. **Check Application Registration**:
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations. Find the app and review the settings including:
     - **Redirect URIs**: Ensure they are correctly configured.
     - **API Permissions**: Ensure the app has the appropriate permissions granted.

3. **Review Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Go to Azure Active Directory > Security > Conditional Access. Check if there are any policies that might block access for the user. If so, modify the policies or add exemptions if necessary.

4. **Contact the Administrator**:
   - If the user lacks permissions or the application is misconfigured, the administrator may need to take action on fixing these settings.

5. **Check Application Status**:
   - Ensure that the application is not turned off or in a state that prevents access. The Admin can check this under Azure Active Directory > Enterprise applications > [Find your app] > Properties.

6. **License Verification**:
   - Verify whether the user has the appropriate licenses under Azure Active Directory > Users > [Select the User] > Licenses.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Ensure that you are using the correct tenant/domain when trying to access the application.
- Check if there are any known outages affecting Azure services which could be causing access issues.
- Be cautious about making changes to permissions or policies without proper validation/testing.

#### Advice for Data Collection

If the issue persists and advanced troubleshooting is required:

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Check the Windows Event Viewer under Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > AzureAD for event logs that may provide insight.

2. **Network Tracing (netsh)**:
   - Use `netsh trace start capture` command in an elevated command prompt before reproducing the issue, and stop with `netsh trace stop` afterwards to gather network trace logs.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Use Fiddler to capture HTTP requests/responses which can help identify if there are any client-side errors or incorrect request configurations during authentication.

These logs will help further diagnose the issue, including looking for any additional error messages that accompany AADSTS1000031.

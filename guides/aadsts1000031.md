#### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **User Permissions**: The user attempting to access the application might not have the appropriate permissions or roles assigned within Azure Active Directory (AAD).

2. **Application Registration Issues**: The application may not be registered correctly in Azure AD, or there may be issues with the application's manifest or permissions.

3. **Tenant Restrictions**: The user may be trying to access the application from the wrong Azure AD tenant, or the tenant might have restrictions that prevent access.

4. **Conditional Access Policies**: There may be conditional access policies in place that restrict access based on location, device state, or other factors.

5. **Service Interruption**: Temporary outages or service interruptions on Azure's end can cause applications to become temporarily inaccessible.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Check User Permissions**:
   - Log into the Azure Portal.
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Users**.
   - Select the user experiencing the issue.
   - Verify that the user is assigned the appropriate role/permissions for accessing the application.

2. **Review Application Registration**:
   - In the Azure Portal, go to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations**.
   - Locate and select the application corresponding to `{appDisplayName}`.
   - Ensure that credentials (client secrets or certificates) are correctly configured and that the necessary permissions are granted.

3. **Inspect Tenant Configurations**:
   - Verify the tenant that the user is trying to log in to.
   - Ensure that cross-tenant access settings permit users to log into the application, if applicable.

4. **Check Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Conditional Access**.
   - Review any policies that might block access for the user. Modify or create exceptions as necessary.

5. **Test with Another User Account**:
   - Attempt to access the application with a different user account that is known to have access. This can help identify if the issue is user-specific.

6. **Consult Azure Support**:
   - If the issue persists and cannot be resolved using the above steps, consider opening a support ticket with Azure support for further assistance.

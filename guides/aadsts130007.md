### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS130007 - NgcDeviceIsDisabled

**Error Code**: AADSTS130007  
**Description**: NgcDeviceIsDisabled - The device is disabled.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Check the Error Context**: Confirm the context in which the error occurred. Is it related to signing into a device, application, or service?
2. **Verify User Authentication**: Ensure that the user is attempting to perform actions for which they have the relevant permissions.
3. **Device Management Policy**: Check if there is a policy in place that would disable the device for authentication.

#### Common Issues that Cause this Error
1. **Device Management Policies**: The device may have been disabled by an administrator through Intune or another device management tool.
2. **User Account Issues**: Sometimes, user accounts could be disabled or blocked due to inactivity or other reasons.
3. **Local Device Issues**: Hardware or configuration issues with the device.
4. **Outdated Windows or Device Driver**: Issues with outdated operating system or drivers that cause the device's functionalities to be disabled inadvertently.
5. **User Credential Issues**: Problems with the user credentials that hinder authentication.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Check Device Status in Intune or Azure AD**:
   - Log in to the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Devices** > **All devices**.
   - Check the status of the concerned device. If it shows "Disabled," contact your administrator to understand why.

2. **Admin Actions**:
   - If you're an admin, consider re-enabling the device:
     - Select the device in the Azure portal, and check for an option to enable or approve it.

3. **User Account Verification**:
   - Check the userâ€™s account status in Azure Active Directory.
   - Make sure the account is not blocked or disabled.

4. **Device and OS Checks**:
   - Ensure that the device is updated to the latest version of Windows OS.
   - Look for any missing or outdated drivers via **Device Manager**, and update them as necessary.
   - Restart the device after updates.

5. **Network and Authentication Issues**:
   - Ensure that the device is connected to a valid network and has internet access.
   - Clear any cached credentials:
     - Open **Credential Manager** and remove old credentials stored for Microsoft accounts that may conflict.

6. **Test Authentication**:
   - Sign out of the current user session and sign back in.
   - Try to reset the device if policies allow (e.g., via **Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Reset this PC**).

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- If users are consistently seeing this error, reviewing overall security policies and device compliance settings is crucial.

# AADSTS50196: LoopDetected - A client loop has been detected. Check the app’s logic to ensure that token caching is implemented, and that error conditions are handled correctly. The app has made too many of the same request in too short a period, indicating that it is in a faulty state or is abusively requesting tokens.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The AADSTS50196 error, with its "LoopDetected" description, indicates that there’s a problem with how an application is handling token requests in the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This issue typically arises when an application is caught in a cycle of continuously requesting tokens without proper handling of its state. Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide to resolve this error.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50196 Error

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Check the HTTP Response**: When you encounter the error, examine the HTTP response for any additional error information. Look for response codes and error messages that might provide further insights.
2. **Review Application Logs**: Look at the application logs around the time the error occurred. Are there any recurring token requests noted?
3. **Monitor Token Requests**: Review the sequence of API calls and token requests made by the application. Identify the flow that leads to the error.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **Token Caching Mismanagement**: The application is not caching tokens properly, making repetitive requests for new tokens unnecessarily.
2. **Failed Error Handling**: The application's error handling might not correctly process or back off after a failed token request, triggering a loop.
3. **Excessive Requests**: The application could be programmed to request tokens too frequently, exceeding Azure AD limits.
4. **Configuration Errors**: Misconfigurations in the application settings or Azure AD app registration could lead to this issue, such as redirect URIs or permissions being set incorrectly.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Implement Proper Token Caching**:
   - Ensure that your application implements caching for access tokens and refresh tokens correctly.
   - Use the access token until it expires and only use the refresh token to obtain a new access token.

2. **Check and Correct Error Handling Logic**:
   - Ensure that your application properly handles errors when requesting tokens.
   - Implement a back-off strategy (exponential backoff) if an error is detected, to prevent rapid repeated requests.

3. **Review Rate Limiting**:
   - Check Azure AD rate limits and ensure your application adheres to them.
   - Limit the number of token requests from your application to avoid quick successive requests.

4. **Configuration Verification**:
   - Review the Azure AD application configuration:
     - Check redirect URIs.
     - Validate permissions and scopes.
   - Ensure that the application settings are correctly aligned with expected service configurations.

5. **Testing in a Controlled Environment**:
   - If possible, replicate the issue in a development or testing environment to understand the timing and conditions that cause the loop.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Network Conditions**: Sometimes network latency or interruptions can lead to temporary failures that can cause excessive token requests.
- **Application Throttling**: Pay attention to traffic management on both the client and server sides to avoid overwhelming the service.
- **Versioning**: Ensure the library versions (MSAL, ADAL, etc.) you use for authentication are updated and follow best practices.

#### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**: Check in the Event Viewer for any application errors or warnings that correspond to the time of the issue.
- **Network Tracing (NetTrace)**: Use tools such as NetMon or Wireshark to analyze network traffic and identify patterns in token requests.
- **Fiddler**: Capture and inspect HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses. Look for patterns in the requests to Azure AD and identify if your application is making redundant requests.

Collecting and analyzing these data points will give you a clearer view of the flow of requests and where the fault may lie in application logic or configuration.

By following the steps outlined above, you should be able to troubleshoot and resolve the AADSTS50196 error effectively.

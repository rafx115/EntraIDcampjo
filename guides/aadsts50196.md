# AADSTS50196: LoopDetected - A client loop has been detected. Check the app’s logic to ensure that token caching is implemented, and that error conditions are handled correctly. The app has made too many of the same request in too short a period, indicating that it is in a faulty state or is abusively requesting tokens.


## Troubleshooting Steps
**Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50196 Error Code:**

**1. Initial Diagnostic Steps:**
- Verify if the error code AADSTS50196 is indeed related to loop detection.
- Review the logs or error messages to see which part of your application triggered the error.
- Check the app's code logic for how it handles token requests and caching.
- Evaluate the frequency of token requests from the app.

**2. Common Issues that Cause this Error:**
- Inadequate implementation of token caching mechanisms.
- Incorrect handling of error conditions in the app.
- Excessive requests for the same token in a short period.
- Bugs or issues causing the app to get into a faulty state.

**3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:**
- **Implement Token Caching:** Ensure that your application implements proper token caching mechanisms to reduce the frequency of token requests.
- **Handle Error Conditions:** Update your app's logic to handle error conditions properly, including cases where token requests may fail due to various reasons.
- **Manage Token Requests:** Review your application's behavior to ensure it does not make too many requests for the same token within a short timeframe.
- **Review App's Code:** Debug and review your application's code to identify any issues that may be causing the loop detection error.
- **Adjust Token Request Frequency:** If necessary, adjust the frequency of token requests made by your application to avoid triggering the loop detection mechanism.

**4. Additional Notes or Considerations:**
- Ensure that your application adheres to Microsoft's guidelines on Azure Active Directory integration and token usage.
- Regularly monitor and review the application's behavior to prevent the recurrence of the loop detection error.
- Consider reaching out to Microsoft support or the relevant documentation for further assistance if needed.

**5. Documentation for Guidance:**
- Microsoft Azure Active Directory Documentation: [Microsoft Identity Platform Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/)

# AADSTS50196: LoopDetected - A client loop has been detected. Check the app’s logic to ensure that token caching is implemented, and that error conditions are handled correctly. The app has made too many of the same request in too short a period, indicating that it is in a faulty state or is abusively requesting tokens.


## Introduction

This guide will help resolve issues related to loopdetected - a client loop has

been detected. check the app’s logic to ensure that token caching is
implemented, and that error conditions are handled correctly. the app has made
too many of the same request in too short a period, indicating that it is in a
faulty state or is abusively requesting tokens..


## Prerequisites


* Access to the Azure AD portal with administrator privileges.

* The user must have already set up MFA.


## Steps to Resolve


### Step 1: Initial Actions

1. Log in to the Azure AD portal.
2. Navigate to the "Users" section.
3. Select the affected user.
4. Perform necessary actions as described for the error.


### Step 2: Verify MFA Settings

1. Ensure that the user has MFA configured.
2. If necessary, guide the user through the MFA setup process.


## Troubleshooting


* Check for any Azure AD conditional access policies that might be affecting the

  MFA process.

* Consider any additional security measures that might be in place.


## Additional Notes


* Refer to the

  [Azure AD 
documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/)

## Troubleshooting Steps

Here is a detailed troubleshooting guide for the error code AADSTS50196 with the
description "LoopDetected - A client loop has been detected":


### Initial Diagnostic Steps:

1. **Confirm the Error:** 

   * Verify that the error code AADSTS50196 is indeed being triggered by your

     application.
   * Check the app logs or error messages to gather more data on the issue.

2. **Check Token Caching Implementation:** 

   * Review the app's code to ensure that token caching logic has been correctly

     implemented.
   * Look for any areas where tokens are being repeatedly requested without

     proper caching.

3. **Inspect Error Handling:**    * Examine how the app responds to error 
conditions, including token request

     failures.
   * Ensure that appropriate error handling mechanisms are in place to prevent

     looping behavior.


### Common Issues Causing the Error:

1. **Missing or Faulty Token Caching Logic:**    * Absence of token caching can 
lead to repeated token requests triggering the

     loop detection mechanism.
2. **Improper Error Handling:**    * Inadequate error handling can result in the 
app getting stuck in a loop

     when dealing with authentication failures.


### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **Review Token Caching Implementation:** 

   * Verify that token caching is correctly implemented in the application.

   * Ensure that the app caches tokens securely and retrieves them as needed to

     avoid repeated requests.

2. **Adjust Token Request Rate:** 

   * Throttle the rate at which token requests are made to the authentication

     server.
   * Ensure that the app does not make excessive requests within a short period

     of time.

3. **Enhance Error Handling:** 

   * Implement robust error handling mechanisms to prevent the app from getting

     stuck in a loop when dealing with authentication failures.
   * Include retry logic with back-off strategies to handle intermittent errors

     gracefully.

4. **Monitor and Log Request Activity:**    * Track the token request activities 
in the app to identify any patterns

     leading to the loop detection.
   * Logging can help in debugging and optimizing the app's behavior during

     authentication.


### Additional Notes or Considerations:


* **Rate Limiting:** Consider implementing rate limiting on token requests to

  prevent abuse and ensure smoother authentication flows.


* **Security Concerns:** Ensure that token caching is done securely to avoid

  exposing sensitive information to unauthorized parties.


* **Testing and Validation:** Thoroughly test the app's authentication flow to

  validate the changes made in response to the loop detection error.

By following these guidelines and addressing the root causes of the AADSTS50196
error, you can improve the reliability and security of your application's
authentication mechanism.

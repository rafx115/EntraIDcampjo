## Troubleshooting Steps
Sure! The error code AADSTS120013, with the description "PasswordChangeOnPremisesConnectivityFailure," typically indicates that there was an issue when trying to change a password on-premises, particularly with connectivity to your on-premises Active Directory (AD) from Azure Active Directory (AAD).

Here’s a detailed troubleshooting guide:

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify the Context:** Determine the scenario under which the error occurred. 
   - User was trying to change their password via Office 365, Azure, or some other service?
   - Was the change initiated from a local device or remote?

2. **Review User Account Status:**
   - Check if the user's account is still active in on-premises AD.
   - Ensure that there are no account lockouts or other issues present.

3. **Connectivity Checks:**
   - Verify if the AD Domain Controller is reachable from the Azure AD connect server if applicable.
   - Check the network path for availability issues or latency.

4. **Check Azure AD Connect Health:**
   - If Azure AD Connect is in use, check Azure AD Connect Health and make sure that synchronization is working properly.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **Network Connectivity Issues:**
   - Firewall or network rules blocking requests from Azure to on-premises AD.
   - VPN or network path issues between Azure AD and on-premises AD.

2. **Azure AD Connect Issues:**
   - The Azure AD Connect service may not be authenticating correctly.
   - Synchronization issues or services being down.

3. **Local Active Directory Issues:**
   - The user may have expired password, or local policies not allowing the change.
   - On-premises AD may not be reachable or properly configured.

4. **Credentials:**
   - If using a password reset feature, the credentials or method used may not be valid or authorized.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Check Network Connectivity:**
   - Use tools like `ping`, `tracert`, or network monitoring tools to check connectivity to the on-premises AD.
   - Ensure that there are no IP restrictions or firewall rules in place preventing access.

2. **Reset User Password in On-Prem AD:**
   - As an admin, reset the user’s password directly in on-premises Active Directory to determine if the issue persists.

3. **Verify Azure AD Connect Status:**
   - Open the Azure AD Connect tool and check synchronization status and any reported errors.
   - Ensure that the Azure AD Connect server is up and running, and that the active directory sync service is operational.

4. **Review Logs:**
   - Review the Azure AD Connect logs for any synchronization or connection errors.
   - Look at the Windows Event Logs on the Azure AD Connect server for any error messages.

5. **Test Account Configuration:**
   - Validate that the User Principal Name (UPN) and necessary attributes are correctly synchronized and configured.
   - Ensure that there are no duplicate UPNs or issues with the account attributes.

6. **Check Password Policies:**
   - Review and ensure that the password policies in the on-prem AD are not overly restrictive and that they allow the type of passwords being set.

7. **Re-Synchronize the Environment:**
   - If issues continue, you may want to perform a manual synchronization using Azure AD Connect’s `Start-ADSyncSyncCycle` cmdlet to attempt to force sync.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Be aware of the replication timing and ensure that there is enough time for the changes made in the on-prem AD to propagate to Azure AD.
- In case of multiple domain controllers, ensure that they have proper replication.

### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs:** Look for relevant entries in the Application and System event logs on the Azure AD Connect server. Common sources include:
   - Azure AD Connect
   - Microsoft.WindowsServer.

- **Nettrace:** You can use tools like Wireshark to capture network packets to see if requests are reaching the on-prem AD. Ensure you look at TCP packets for connection issues.

- **Fiddler:** If applicable, you could use Fiddler to inspect HTTP requests being sent to Azure AD, ensuring the requests are formatted correctly.

Collect these logs and outputs when troubleshooting, as they will provide valuable insight into what might be going wrong.

## Troubleshooting Steps

Error code AADSTS120013 with the description
"PasswordChangeOnPremisesConnectivityFailure" typically indicates an issue with
the connectivity between Azure AD and the on-premises Active Directory when
attempting to change or reset passwords. Here's a detailed troubleshooting guide
to resolve this error:

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:** 

1. **Confirm the Error:** Ensure that the error consistently occurs and is not a

   one-time occurrence.

2. **Check Connectivity:** Verify the connectivity between Azure AD and the

   on-premises Active Directory by testing communication channels.

3. **Review Logs:** Check relevant logs such as Azure AD Connect logs, Event

   Viewer logs, and Azure AD logs for any related errors or warnings.

4. **Verify Credentials:** Ensure that the credentials used for Azure AD Connect

   have the necessary permissions to synchronize changes.

**Common Issues Causing This Error:** 

1. **Network Connectivity:** Issues with network connectivity can prevent Azure

   AD from connecting to the on-premises Active Directory.

2. **Firewall Restrictions:** Firewalls blocking communication between Azure AD

   and the on-premises Active Directory can lead to this error.

3. **Azure AD Connect Configuration:** Misconfigurations in Azure AD Connect

   settings can cause connectivity failures.

**Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:** 

1. **Check Network Connectivity:** 

   * Verify that there are no network issues between Azure AD and the

     on-premises Active Directory.
   * Ensure that necessary ports for Azure AD Connect are open on the firewall.

2. **Review Azure AD Connect Configuration:** 

   * Check the Azure AD Connect configuration for any misconfigurations.

   * Ensure that the account used for synchronization has the required

     permissions in the on-premises Active Directory.

3. **Restart Azure AD Connect Services:** 

   * Restart the Azure AD Connect services to ensure a fresh connection attempt.

4. **Reset Password in Azure Portal:**    * If the issue persists, try resetting 
the password for the affected user

     directly in the Azure portal.

**Additional Notes or Considerations:**


* **Permissions:** Ensure that the account used for password synchronization has

  the necessary permissions in both Azure AD and the on-premises Active
  Directory.

* **Testing:** Test password changes for other users to determine if the issue

  is user-specific or system-wide.

* **Documentation:** Refer to official Microsoft documentation for

  troubleshooting this specific error code for additional insights.

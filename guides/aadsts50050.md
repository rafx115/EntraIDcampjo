# AADSTS50050: MalformedDiscoveryRequest - The request is malformed.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Here�s a detailed troubleshooting guide for resolving the error code **AADSTS50050**, which states **"MalformedDiscoveryRequest - The request is malformed."**

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50050

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Review the Error Message**: Take note of any additional context or information provided with the error message. This can help narrow down the issue.
2. **Check the Request URL**: Evaluate the URL used for the discovery request. Look for obvious issues such as typographical errors, incorrect formatting, or invalid characters.
3. **Inspect Client Configuration**: Check the configuration settings in your application, particularly those related to Azure AD authentication.

#### Common Issues Causing AADSTS50050:
1. **Incorrect Redirect URI**: The redirect URI specified in the application might not match the one registered in Azure AD.
2. **Malformed URL**: URLs should adhere strictly to standards. This includes ensuring that query parameters are well-formed and properly encoded.
3. **Missing/Invalid Client IDs**: The application might be using a wrong or outdated client ID configured in Azure AD.
4. **Scope Request Issues**: If scopes are being requested in the wrong format, that can lead to a malformed request.
5. **Misconfiguration of the Azure App**: Issues may arise if there's a discrepancy between the application's settings in Azure AD and how they're being referenced in the code or configuration.
6. **Expired Certificates or Secrets**: If you are using client credentials to authenticate, check for any expired tokens or certificates.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Inspect and Validate the Discovery Request URL**:
   - Confirm the request URL follows a standard format (e.g., `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}//.well-known/openid-configuration`).
   - Validate any parameters included in the request.

2. **Check Azure AD Application Registration**:
   - Go to the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to �Azure Active Directory� > �App registrations�.
   - Identify your app and ensure the Redirect URIs are configured correctly.

3. **Ensure Valid Client Information**:
   - Check the client ID and ensure it matches what is registered in the Azure portal. 
   - If you're utilizing client secrets or certificates, ensure they are valid and have not expired.

4. **Review Scope and Permissions**:
   - Confirm the scopes being requested are correctly defined and valid.
   - Make sure permissions have been granted in Azure AD for the requested scopes.

5. **Test with Minimal Configuration**: 
   - Temporarily simplify your requests to the bare minimum (e.g., using just a client ID and secret) to isolate the problem.

6. **Capture Network Traffic (if applicable)**:
   - Use tools like Fiddler or browser developer tools to capture the network traffic involved in the authentication process.
   - Check the outgoing request details against expected formats.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- Ensure that you have appropriate permissions in Azure AD to access and modify application registration settings.
- If you're executing requests programmatically, check for any potential application logic that might modify or incorrectly construct the request.

#### Testing Documentation Reachability:
- You can test the links provided by opening them in a web browser or using a tool like `curl` to ensure they are accessible:
```bash
curl -I https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-overview
```
If the URLs respond with a 200 status code, they are reachable.

#### Advice for Data Collection:
- Gather detailed logs from your application including the exact request sent to Azure AD and the corresponding response.
- Document the steps you took leading up to the error, including changes in configuration and other relevant context.
- Use monitoring tools to track request patterns and any abnormal spikes or failures in authentication attempts.

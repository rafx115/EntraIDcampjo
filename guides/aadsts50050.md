# AADSTS50050: MalformedDiscoveryRequest - The request is malformed.


## Troubleshooting Steps
## Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50050 Error

### Overview
The AADSTS50050 error indicates a malformed discovery request when interacting with Azure Active Directory (AAD). This occurs when the request for authentication or token acquisition is not formatted correctly.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Check the Request URL**: Review the URL being used for the discovery request. Ensure that it adheres to the required format for AAD. Common endpoints for discovery requests include:
   - `/common/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration`
   - `/common/discovery/v2.0/`

2. **Validate the Request Parameters**: Ensure all required parameters are included in the request, such as:
   - `client_id`
   - `response_type`
   - `redirect_uri`
   - `scope`

3. **Inspect Logs**: If available, check logs in the application from which the request is initiated. Look for any related error messages or additional context around the time of the request failure.

### Common Issues That Cause AADSTS50050
1. **Incorrect URL Structure**: The request URL may have typos or incorrect segment structure (e.g., mixed usage of v1 and v2 endpoints).

2. **JSON Formatting Errors**: If the discovery request includes JSON bodies, ensure that the JSON is properly formatted and that it's valid (e.g., no trailing commas, correct braces).

3. **Missing Required Parameters**: If any required URL parameters are missing or poorly encoded, the request will be malformed.

4. **Improper Encoding**: Ensure that all URI components are properly encoded following RFC 3986. Special characters should be percent-encoded.

5. **Configuration Issues**: Issues with the application registration in the Azure portal (e.g., incorrect redirect URIs or misconfigured settings).

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Review and Correct the Request URL**:
   - Confirm that the endpoint you're hitting is correct for your application's needs (v1 or v2 endpoint). Make sure to refer to the latest Microsoft documentation.
   
2. **Validate All Request Parameters**:
   - List all the parameters being sent in the request.
   - Ensure that every required parameter is included and correctly spelled.
   - Validate that parameter values conform to expected formats (e.g., valid `redirect_uri`).

3. **Use a Tool to Validate URIs**:
   - Utilize tools like [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/) or similar to verify the structure of JWTs if involved in the request.

4. **Check Application Registration in Azure**:
   - Log into the Azure portal, navigate to "Azure Active Directory" > "App registrations" and check configurations:
     - Ensure "Redirect URIs" are set correctly.
     - Check API permissions and required scopes.

5. **Debugging with Fiddler or Postman**:
   - Use Fiddler or Postman to intercept the outgoing request to ensure that the HTTP method (GET/POST) and body/parameter formats are correctly established.
   - Look for discrepancies in headers and other parts of the request.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure network filters or firewalls aren't altering the request during travel.
- Be cautious with URL length; some browsers or proxies might truncate overly long URLs.
- If integrating with third-party frameworks or SDKs, ensure you are using the latest versions that might address known issues.

### Advice for Data Collection
1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Check the Windows Event Viewer for Application logs that might contain additional error and warning logs related to your application.

2. **Network Traces**:
   - Tools like `nettrace` or `Wireshark` can capture network traffic. Look for HTTP requests and responses to see the raw data being sent and received.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Capture the HTTP/HTTPS traffic via Fiddler to analyze the request/response pairs. Look for headers, request methods, redirect URIs, and any additional data sent.

By following this structured troubleshooting guide, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the AADSTS50050 error effectively.

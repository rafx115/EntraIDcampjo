## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS120020: "PasswordChangeFailure"

#### **Initial Diagnostic Steps**
1. **Verify User Account Status:**
   - Confirm that the user account is active and not locked, disabled, or otherwise restricted.
   - Check if the account is managed by Azure AD, a tenant admin, or a federated identity provider.

2. **Check Password Policy:**
   - Ensure that the new password meets the organization's password policy requirements (minimum length, complexity, etc.).

3. **Authentication Method:**
   - Review the authentication method the user is trying to use (e.g., self-service password reset, legacy protocols).

4. **User's Last Sign-In:**
   - Check the user's last successful authentication and any recent attempts to change their password.

#### **Common Issues that Cause this Error**
1. **Incorrect Password Format:**
   - The new password might not meet the security requirements established by the organization.

2. **Password Expiry:**
   - If the password has expired, it may not allow a change until the user is authenticated.

3. **Account Lockout:**
   - The user may have hit a locked-out state due to failed attempts during password change.

4. **Service Outages:**
   - There may be temporary issues with Azure Active Directory services.

5. **Network Issues:**
   - Connectivity problems that could prevent the password change request.

6. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Issues:**
   - Problems with additional authentication factors that may not have been completed successfully.

7. **Federated Sign-In Issues:**
   - If the organization uses a federated sign-in, issues with the federation service might interfere with password changes.

#### **Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies**
1. **Attempt Password Change Again:**
   - Have the user try to change the password again, ensuring they correctly enter the current password and meet all complexity rules.

2. **Check Account Properties:**
   - Ask an admin to check user properties in Azure AD to verify account status, and reset the user's password if necessary.

3. **Review Password Policies:**
   - Make sure users comply with the organizationâ€™s password policies. Update documentation for the password requirements if necessary.

4. **Use the Correct Portal/Method:**
   - Direct the user to the appropriate portal or method for changing their password (e.g., Azure AD Self-Service Password Reset).

5. **Clear Cache/Cookies:**
   - Have users clear browser cache and cookies or try a different browser to rule out cached credential issues.

6. **Network Connectivity:**
   - Confirm with network administrators that there are no network issues (DNS, firewall, etc.) preventing access to relevant services.

7. **Engage IT Support:**
   - If the issues persist, escalate the matter to IT support for deeper investigation, considering logs and tenant health.

#### **Additional Notes or Considerations**
- **Documentation Review:**
  - Review documentation for the user's authentication method, especially when using legacy protocols or external identities.
- **Backups:**
  - Encourage users to keep their contact information up-to-date in their Azure AD profile to assist with self-service scenarios.

#### **Documentation for Guidance**
- Azure AD password management documentation: [Microsoft Docs - Manage passwords in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/user-help/user-help-passwords)
- Troubleshoot common Azure AD sign-in errors: [AAD Sign-in Error Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aad-error-codes)

#### **Advice for Data Collection**
1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - Check the Event Viewer on the client machine for any application or system errors related to the password change attempt or sign-in.

2. **Network Tracing (Nettrace):**
   - Use netsh trace to capture network traffic when attempting to change the password for debugging.
   ```shell
   netsh trace start capture=yes
   ```
   - Stop the trace after reproduction and analyze using the Message Analyzer or Wireshark.

3. **Fiddler:**
   - Use Fiddler to inspect HTTP traffic between the client and the Azure AD service when the password change occurs. Look for request and response codes and bodies for any errors returned by the server.

By following the troubleshooting guide above, you should be able to identify and resolve the AADSTS120020 error effectively.

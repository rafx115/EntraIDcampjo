# AADSTS28003: Provided value for the input parameter scope can't be empty when requesting an access token using the provided authorization code. Specify a valid scope.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS28003

The error code AADSTS28003 indicates that a required parameter, specifically the "scope" parameter in your request for an access token, is either empty or missing when using an authorization code. This guide provides detailed steps for diagnosing and resolving the issue.

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Verify the Error Message**: Ensure that the error code is indeed AADSTS28003 and review the associated message to confirm it refers specifically to the "scope".

2. **Check the Application's OAuth 2.0 Flow**: Understand which flow your application is using (Authorization Code flow) and ensure that itâ€™s implemented correctly.

3. **Review the Request**: Examine the exact request being sent to Azure AD for the access token to confirm whether the "scope" parameter is present and populated.

### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **Missing Scope Parameter**: The "scope" parameter is not included in the token request.

2. **Empty Scope Value**: The "scope" parameter is included but lacks a value (e.g., it could be an empty string or whitespace).

3. **Incorrect Scope Format**: The scope value must be correctly formatted. Scopes should follow the format `https://{resource}/.default` or may contain space-separated scopes.

4. **Authorization Code Expiration**: The authorization code obtained earlier may expire, invalidating the request.

5. **Incorrect Redirect URI**: The redirect URI used while exchanging the code may not match the one registered in Azure AD for your application.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

#### Step 1: Verify Scope Parameter

- Check the code that generates the access token request.
- Ensure that the "scope" parameter is explicitly defined and not empty. It should look something like this:
  
  ```plaintext
  scope=https://yourapi/.default
  ```

#### Step 2: Ensure Correct Scope Format

- Ensure that the scope string is correctly formatted and contains valid permissions. For example:
  
  ```plaintext
  scope=https://graph.microsoft.com/.default
  ```

- If using multiple scopes, they should be space-separated. Example:
  
  ```plaintext
  scope=https://graph.microsoft.com/user.read https://graph.microsoft.com/mail.read
  ```

#### Step 3: Authorization Code Handling

- Ensure that the authorization code received from the authorization endpoint is being correctly captured and is still valid.
- Avoid using the authorization code more than once as it often becomes invalid after a single use.

#### Step 4: Redirect URI Verification

- Compare the redirect URI in the token request with the one registered in Azure AD.
- Ensure that both URIs match exactly, including any potential trailing slashes or differences in capitalization.

#### Step 5: Review Application Registration

- Log in to the Azure portal, navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations.
- Find your application and check the API permissions and scopes that have been configured.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Make sure your application has the correct API permissions granted and that admin consent has been provided where necessary.
- Check your Azure AD logs for any additional errors that may provide context related to the authorization code flow and token request.
- Monitor for any transient issues that might be affecting the Azure service.

### Advice for Data Collection Tools

- **Event Viewer Logs**: Collect logs related to your application on Windows event logs to check for application-specific errors during token requests.
  
- **Network Tracing**: Use tools like `nettrace` to capture network traffic during the token request to examine the outgoing request details. Look for the presence of the "scope" parameter.

- **Fiddler**: Utilize Fiddler to inspect traffic. You can set up Fiddler to decrypt HTTPS traffic to view request and response bodies, allowing you to confirm all parameters are being sent as intended.

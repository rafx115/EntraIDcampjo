### Step 1: Initial Actions
1. Log in to the Azure AD portal.
2. Navigate to the "Users" section.
3. Select the affected user.
4. Perform necessary actions as described for the error.

### Step 2: Verify MFA Settings
1. Ensure that the user has MFA configured.
2. If necessary, guide the user through the MFA setup process.

## Troubleshooting
- Check for any Azure AD conditional access policies that might be affecting the MFA process.
- Consider any additional security measures that might be in place.

### Troubleshooting Guide: AADSTS700025 - InvalidClientPublicClientWithCredential

#### Description:
The error code AADSTS700025 indicates an issue related to client authentication in Azure Active Directory (AAD). Specifically, the error message InvalidClientPublicClientWithCredential - Client is public so neither 'client_assertion' nor 'client_secret' should be presented suggests a conflict with how client authentication is being handled for a public client.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Confirm Client Type:** Verify whether the client interacting with the Azure AD is correctly designated as a public client. Check the client application registration settings in Azure Portal.
2. **Check Client Credentials:** Ensure that the client is not attempting to present 'client_assertion' or 'client_secret' in the authentication process as public clients are not supposed to provide these credentials.

#### Common Issues Causing the Error:
- Misconfiguration of client type in the Azure AD application settings.
- Incorrect usage of client credentials by a public client.
- Mismatch between the authentication method being used and the client type designation.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Update Client Type:**
    - Navigate to Azure Portal and locate the affected client application's registration.
    - Ensure that the client is correctly designated as a public client. Update the application registration if needed.
  
2. **Adjust Authentication Method:**
    - Public clients in Azure AD should utilize other authentication methods like implicit grant flow instead of 'client_assertion' or 'client_secret'.
    - Modify the authentication flow in the client application to align with the requirements for public clients.

3. **Check Token Requests:**
    - Review the token requests sent by the client to Azure AD. Ensure that the request does not include 'client_assertion' or 'client_secret' for a public client.

4. **Revoke and Regenerate Credentials:**
    - If there are any invalid or mismatched credentials associated with the client, revoke and regenerate them in the Azure AD application registration settings.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- Public clients in Azure AD are typically applications running on devices that cannot securely store a client secret, like desktop or mobile applications.
- Ensure that the client application follows best practices for handling authentication flow recommended for public clients in Azure AD.
- Keep track of any changes made to the client application configuration to identify the source of the error if further troubleshooting is required.

Following these steps should help resolve the error AADSTS700025 related to InvalidClientPublicClientWithCredential in Azure Active Directory. If the issue persists, further investigation into the client configuration and authentication flow may be needed.

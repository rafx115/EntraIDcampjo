# AADSTS700025: InvalidClientPublicClientWithCredential - Client is public so neither 'client_assertion' nor 'client_secret' should be presented.


## Troubleshooting Steps
**Troubleshooting Guide: Error Code AADSTS700025 - InvalidClientPublicClientWithCredential**

**Description:**  
The error code AADSTS700025 with the description "InvalidClientPublicClientWithCredential" occurs when the client is declared as public, meaning it should not present either a 'client_assertion' or 'client_secret'.

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:**
1. **Verify Client Configuration**: Check the client's configuration in Azure AD to ensure it is defined as a public client.
2. **Review Authentication Request**: Check the authentication request being sent to Azure AD to identify any incorrect or unauthorized parameters.

**Common Issues:**
1. **Incorrect Client Configuration**: The client is mistakenly defined as a confidential client rather than a public client in Azure AD.
2. **Misconfigured Authentication Request**: The request includes 'client_assertion' or 'client_secret' despite the client being public.

**Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:**
1. **Check Client Configuration**:
   - Log in to Azure Portal.
   - Go to Azure Active Directory > App registrations.
   - Locate the problematic application and verify its manifest or properties to ensure it is set as a public client.
  
2. **Review Authentication Request**:
   - Inspect the authentication request being made, including headers and parameters.
   - Remove any 'client_assertion' or 'client_secret' from the request if the client is public.

3. **Update Client Configuration**:
   - If the client is incorrectly set as confidential, update its configuration to be a public client.
   - Ensure that all the relevant settings align with the requirements for a public client in Azure AD.

**Additional Notes or Considerations:**
- **Client Type**: Public clients are typically single-page apps, mobile apps, or desktop apps where the client cannot securely store a client secret.
- **Scopes and Permissions**: Verify that the requested scopes and permissions align with the client's configuration and capabilities.
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling mechanisms to provide informative messages to users or developers.

**Documentation for Guidance:**
- For more detailed steps and guidelines, refer to the Microsoft Azure AD documentation on [Defining application types with Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-expose-web-apis#defining-application-types) and [Client types and application configuration in Azure AD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/about-app-objects-and-service-principals).

By following these troubleshooting steps and considerations, you should be able to address the error code AADSTS700025 related to the "InvalidClientPublicClientWithCredential" issue in Azure AD.

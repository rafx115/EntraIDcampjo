# AADSTS700025: InvalidClientPublicClientWithCredential - Client is public so neither 'client_assertion' nor 'client_secret' should be presented.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS700025 Error

**Error Code Description:**
The error code AADSTS700025 indicates that a public client application is attempting to use confidential client credentials (such as `client_assertion` or `client_secret`). Public clients should not use these credentials, as they are not designed to securely store secrets.

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Review the Application Type:**
   - Confirm whether the application is registered as a public client or a confidential client in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). 

2. **Check the Authentication Method:**
   - Identify how the application is attempting to authenticate. Review the code and configuration for any inadvertent use of `client_secret`.

3. **Analyze the Request:**
   - Examine the access token or authorization request being sent to Azure AD for any illogical parameters related to client credentials.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Incorrect Client Registration:**
   - The application is registered as a public client but is configured with a client secret in the authentication code.

2. **Misconfiguration in Authentication Libraries:**
   - Client libraries (like MSAL or ADAL) may be incorrectly set up to utilize a client secret instead of relying on interactive authentication.

3. **Code Bugs:**
   - Mistyped or mistakenly included parameters in API calls to Azure AD.

4. **Outdated Libraries:**
   - Usage of outdated SDK versions that might not adhere to current best practices for public clients.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify Application Configuration:**
   - Go to the Azure Portal:
     - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations**.
     - Select your application and ensure it is marked as **Public client (mobile & desktop)** if it is intended to be a public client.

2. **Remove Client Secret:**
   - If you find a client secret is associated with your public client application, remove the client secret from your application's code and Azure AD.

3. **Update Authentication Code:**
   - Modify your application's authentication code:
     - Use token acquisition methods appropriate for public clients (like interactive prompts or device code flow).
     - Ensure there are no calls to methods that expect a client secret or assertion.

4. **Test with Simplified Scenarios:**
   - Simplify the authentication scenario by using examples from the official documentation to test connectivity and acquire tokens without additional complexity.

5. **Demo Applications:**
   - Use example applications provided by Microsoft to ensure your application's architecture aligns with recommended practices.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Public vs. Confidential Clients:**
  - Understand the difference between public and confidential clients. Public clients are typically desktop, mobile, or browser-based apps that don't keep credentials confidential, while confidential clients (like web applications or server-side applications) can keep secrets secure.

- **Security Implications:**
  - If your application needs to maintain a client secret, you should consider restructuring it to be a confidential client.

### Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer Logs, Network Traces)

1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - Check for any application-specific error logs that may provide additional context.
   - Look for any exceptions captured in your application that can explain deeper issues.

2. **Network Traces:**
   - Use **Fiddler** or **Wireshark** to trace the network calls made during authentication. Look closely at the requests sent to Azure AD.
   - Capture detailed data about what is sent in your authentication request and the corresponding HTTP response.

3. **Net Tracing for .NET Applications:**
   - If you are developing a .NET application, consider enabling WCF or runtime tracing to gather in-depth data about the authentication process.

4. **Check for Logs in Azure AD:**
   - In the Azure Portal, navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Sign-ins** and check for errors corresponding to the time of the incident. This may provide more context regarding the error returned.

By following these steps and referenced strategies, you should be able to troubleshoot and resolve the AADSTS700025 error effectively.

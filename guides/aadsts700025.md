# AADSTS700025: InvalidClientPublicClientWithCredential - Client is public so neither 'client_assertion' nor 'client_secret' should be presented.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### AADSTS700025 Troubleshooting Guide

#### Error Overview
The error code `AADSTS700025` indicates that a client application, recognized as a "public client", is attempting to authenticate with Azure AD using either a `client_assertion` or `client_secret`, which is not allowed for public clients. Public clients are typically applications like mobile or desktop apps that cannot securely store secrets.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify the Type of Application**: Confirm whether your application is indeed registered as a public client in Azure AD. This can be done in the Azure portal under the “App registrations” section.
2. **Review the Authentication Flow**: Analyze how your application is trying to authenticate. Are you using the Authorization Code Flow, Device Code Flow, or some other method?
3. **Check the Credentials**: Review the configuration where you have specified the `client_secret` or `client_assertion`.

### Common Issues that Cause This Error
1. **Misconfiguration of App Registration**: The application might be registered incorrectly, indicating it can use a client secret when it should not.
2. **Incorrect Authentication Flow**: Using an authentication flow that is not suitable for public clients, such as the one which requires client credentials.
3. **Attempting to use `client_secret` or `client_assertion` in a Public Client**: This is the primary cause of this error.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify Application Registration**:
   - Go to the Azure Portal ([portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)).
   - Navigate to "Azure Active Directory" > "App registrations".
   - Find your application and check the **Authentication** settings. Ensure that the application is indeed marked as a "public client" (you can check the box labeled “Allow public client flows”).
  
2. **Remove Client Secret in Configurations**:
   - If your application is marked as a public client, make sure to remove any instances where the `client_secret` or `client_assertion` is configured in your application's code or configuration files.
   - For example, in your app's configuration, ensure that neither of these fields is being set when you attempt to acquire tokens.

3. **Choose Correct Authentication Flow**:
   - When using public clients, ensure you are using flows like:
     - **Authorization Code Flow** with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange).
     - **Device Code Flow** for devices that don’t have a web browser.
   - Review documentation to implement these flows:
     - [Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth-implicit-flow)
     - [Device Authorization Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-device-code-flow)

4. **Test Valid Token Requests**:
   - Use tools like Postman to test token requests without `client_secret` or `client_assertion` to see if the error still occurs.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Understand Public vs Confidential Clients**: Familiarize yourself with the difference between public and confidential clients. Public clients are those that cannot be trusted with client secrets.
- **App Updates**: If your application was previously working but has started throwing this error, consider any recent changes in the app configuration or Azure AD settings.

### Advice for Data Collection
- **Logs**: If the problem persists, check your application logs for detailed error messages.
- **Network Trace**: Use tools like Fiddler or built-in browser developer tools to capture requests and responses during the authentication process.
- **Azure AD Sign-in Logs**: Check Azure AD Sign-in logs for further details and context surrounding the authentication attempts.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify the cause of the `AADSTS700025` error and resolve it effectively. If issues persist, consider reaching out to Microsoft Support for further assistance.

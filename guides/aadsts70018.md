# AADSTS70018: BadVerificationCode - Invalid verification code due to User typing in wrong user code for device code flow. Authorization isn't approved.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS70018 "BadVerificationCode"

**Error Description**: 
The error code **AADSTS70018** indicates that the verification code entered during the device code flow for user authentication is invalid. This usually occurs because the user has entered an incorrect code or the code has expired.

#### **1. Initial Diagnostic Steps:**
- **Verify the Code Entry**: Ensure that the user is entering the correct code. 
  - Confirm that they are not accidentally including any spaces or mistyping characters.
  - Remind them that the code is typically case-sensitive.
  
- **Check the Expiration**: Device codes usually have a limited duration. Verify if enough time has passed since the code was issued.
  - Typically, device codes expire within a few minutes (5-10 minutes).

- **Verify the Device Flow**: Confirm that the user is following the correct steps for the device code flow as per the Azure Active Directory documentation.
  
#### **2. Common Issues that Cause This Error:**
- **Incorrect Code Entry**: The user may be entering the code incorrectly.
- **Expired Code**: The code has expired before it was used.
- **Wrong Tenant or Application**: The user may be attempting to authenticate against the wrong tenant or application.
- **Network Issues**: Temporary connectivity issues that could interfere with the code validation process.

#### **3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:**
- **Resend the Code:**
  1. Instruct the user to initiate the device code flow again to receive a new verification code.
  2. Guide them to carefully enter the new code without mistakes.

- **Check for Typos:**
  1. Have the user verify the exact code they received and ensure they are inputting it correctly on the verification site.
  
- **Timing Verification:**
  1. Check the time elapsed since the verification code was issued.
  2. If the code has expired, instruct the user to request a new one.

- **Check Application and Tenant:**
  1. Ensure the user is interacting with the correct application and tenant.
  2. Verify the Client ID and other parameters used in the request are correct.

- **Network Diagnosis:**
  1. Check internet connectivity to ascertain that there are no local network issues hindering the process.
  2. Suggest trying a different network if they continue to experience issues.

- **Encoding and Case Sensitivity:**
  1. Ensure to input the verification code exactly as it appears without modification, paying attention to any potential encoding issues such as spaces or special characters.

#### **4. Additional Notes or Considerations:**
- Encourage users to perform these actions in a calm manner, as anxiety to complete the authentication may lead to mistakes.
- Ensure that the code is entered into the correct portal provided in the device code flow instructions and that users are aware of using a supported browser.
  
#### **5. Documentation for Guidance:**
- Azure Device Code Flow documentation: [Microsoft Docs - Device code flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth-device-code)
- Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) guidance on device code flow: [MSAL for .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-net-overview)

#### **6. Advice for Data Collection:**
If issues persist, it may be useful to gather logs and trace information:

- **Event Viewer Logs**: Monitor Windows Event Viewer for any relevant logs related to authentication failures.
- **Network Trace (NetTrace)**: Use `Netsh` or other tools to capture network activity which can provide insight into whether requests/responses are blocked or malformed.
- **Fiddler**: Use Fiddler to inspect HTTP requests and responses during the authentication process.
  - Check for:
    - Incorrect request formats.
    - Response headers indicating why a verification code failed.

By following this detailed troubleshooting guide, you should be able to resolve issues related to the AADSTS70018 error.

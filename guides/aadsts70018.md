# AADSTS70018: BadVerificationCode - Invalid verification code due to User typing in wrong user code for device code flow. Authorization isn't approved.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Below is a comprehensive troubleshooting guide for the AADSTS70018 error code related to Azure Active Directory (AAD) during the device code flow authentication process.

### AADSTS70018 Troubleshooting Guide

#### Error Description
**Error Code:** AADSTS70018  
**Message:** BadVerificationCode - Invalid verification code due to User typing in wrong user code for device code flow. Authorization isn't approved.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify Affected User(s):**
   - Find out who is encountering the error. Specificity can help narrow down the troubleshooting.

2. **Reproduce the Issue:**
   - Ask the user to explain or demonstrate the steps they followed leading to the error.
   - Confirm if the error occurs consistently or sporadically.

3. **Check Timestamp:**
   - Ensure that the user is using the verification code within the allowed timeframe (typically 10 minutes).

4. **Verify User and Device Status:**
   - Ensure the user account is active and that they have permissions to log in.
   - Confirm that the device is compliant with any organizational policies if applicable.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **User Input Error:**
   - Users may mistype the verification code or fail to enter it correctly.

2. **Expired Verification Code:**
   - The input verification code might have expired if it is not used promptly.

3. **Wrong Verification Code:**
   - Users might be confusing different verification codes if they are logged into multiple devices or applications.

4. **Network Issues:**
   - Poor connectivity can also lead to incorrect processing of the verification request.

5. **Multiple Attempts:**
   - Repeated incorrect code entries may lock out the user or invalidate the session.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Re-enter the Verification Code:**
   - Instruct the user to generate a new verification code:
     - They should go through the device code flow again for a fresh code.

2. **Ensure Correct Entry:**
   - Verify the user carefully inputs the verification code, ensuring no mistakes in spelling or digits. 
   - Using copy-paste can lead to including accidental spaces; recommend manual entry if needed.

3. **Check Expiration:**
   - Confirm that they are using the generated code before it expires (typically within 10 minutes). If the code is expired, a new one needs to be generated.

4. **Network Connectivity:**
   - Ensure that both the user's device and the authentication server have stable network connections.

5. **Consult Authentication Logs:**
   - Check Azure AD login logs for specific user details, errors, and failed login attempts to gather more context.

6. **User Guidance:**
   - Provide clear instructions to users on how to obtain and enter the verification code, potentially using screenshots or step-by-step guidance.

7. **Documentation Review:**
   - Refer the user to the Microsoft documentation on Device Code Flow to understand the expected behavior:
     - [Azure Active Directory device code flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-device-code)

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Multiple Codes:** If a user is engaging with multiple applications that utilize device code flows, ensure they are not mixing codes across devices or applications.
- **User Experience:** Consider running a user training session on using device codes effectively to reduce future occurrences.

### Documentation Where Steps Can Be Found for Guidance
- Official Microsoft Docs:
  - [Overview of Device Code Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-device-code)
  - [Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-authentication-libraries)

### Test the Documentation Can Be Reachable
To ensure that these documents are reachable, visit the above URLs in a web browser to confirm access. If there are connectivity issues, check your internet connection or access configurations.

### Advice for Data Collection
- **Gather User Feedback:**
  - Collect specific details about the error, including the exact verification code used (without exposing sensitive info), the time of occurrence, and the steps followed.
  
- **Logging:**
  - Enable logging on Azure AD to capture authentication attempts. This will help in diagnosing issues not only with the code but also with user permissions.
  
- **Network Information:**
  - Note down the network status (Wi-Fi, LAN, Mobile) and signal strength at the time of the error.

By following this comprehensive guide, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the AADSTS70018 authentication error effectively. If the issue persists, consider escalating to your IT department or Microsoft's support for further assistance.

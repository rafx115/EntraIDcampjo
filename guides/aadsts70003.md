## Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS70003 - UnsupportedGrantType Error

### **1. Initial Diagnostic Steps**

1. **Identify the Source of the Error:**
   - Determine where the error is occurring (e.g., web application, mobile application, API).
   - Gather relevant error messages and context (e.g., logs or console outputs).

2. **Check the Grant Type in Use:**
   - Identify the grant type being used in your application (e.g., Authorization Code, Client Credentials, Implicit).
   - Review the application code/configuration for the specific grant type being requested.

3. **Review Configuration in Azure AD:**
   - Ensure the application is registered in the Azure portal (Azure Active Directory > App registrations).
   - Verify that the correct permission scopes are granted and configured.

### **2. Common Issues that Cause this Error**

- **Unsupported Grant Type:**
  - The application is attempting to use a grant type that is not configured or supported.
  
- **Client Configuration Issues:**
  - The client configuration (redirect URIs, application types) does not match expected parameters.
  
- **Misconfigured Application Permissions:**
  - The app might lack necessary permissions or has not consented to them.

- **Version Compatibility:**
  - Use of deprecated or outdated libraries that don't support the required grant type.

- **Incorrect OAuth Flow:**
  - Using the incorrect OAuth flow for the type of application (e.g., using Authorization Code flow in a context where Implicit flow should apply).

### **3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies**

1. **Confirm Supported Grant Types:**
   - Go to the [Azure Active Directory Authentication Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow).
   - Check which grant types are supported and ensured that the chosen grant type is on this list.

2. **Examine Application Registration:**
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations > Your Application > Authentication.
   - Review the following:
     - **Redirect URIs:** Ensure these match the URIs used in your code.
     - **Supported Account Types:** Verify if the application is allowed to sign in users from other directories, if applicable.

3. **Review the Code and OAuth Flow:**
   - Verify the `grant_type` parameter in your token request; it should match the supported types.
   - If you are using client credentials or authorization codes, ensure flows are implemented correctly.
   - Refer to references of examples for the right implementation on the [Microsoft Authentication Libraries Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v2-dotnet-core).

4. **Check Application Permissions:**
   - Ensure your application has permissions for the requested scopes in Azure AD.
   - If working with delegated permissions, ensure the user has consented to the required permissions.

5. **Test Using Postman or Similar Tools:**
   - Use tools like Postman to manually test the authentication endpoint with the same parameters your application is using. This isolates whether itâ€™s a code issue or configuration issue.

### **4. Additional Notes or Considerations**

- **Token Expiry and Refresh Tokens:**
  - Ensure that the tokens are not expired, which can sometimes translate to using an unsupported flow.

- **Application Environment:**
  - If your application has different environments (development vs. production), ensure all environments have similar configuration.

- **Client Library Updates:**
  - If using a third-party library for authentication, confirm that you are using the latest version.

### **5. Documentation for Guidance**

- [Azure Active Directory Authentication Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)
- [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749)
- [Understanding Azure Active Directory Tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-advanced-sign-in-protocols)

### **6. Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer Logs, Nettrace, Fiddler)**

- **Event Viewer Logs:**
  - Inspect application logs for any additional details or stack traces that may indicate the issue's root cause. Look under **Windows Logs > Application**.

- **Using Fiddler or Network Tracing:**
  - Capture HTTP requests using Fiddler or built-in network traces to see the actual request and response. Look closely at the `grant_type` and any error responses from the authorization server.
  - Check the response status code, and headers, and identify the exact request that resulted in the error.

- **Enable Detailed Logging:**
  - If applicable, enable verbose logging in your application to obtain more details on authentication attempts.

By following these guidelines, you should be able to identify the cause of the AADSTS70003 error and resolve it effectively. If issues persist, consider reaching out to Microsoft support for further assistance.

## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50027 Error Code: InvalidJwtToken

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Check Token Claims**: Verify the contents of the JWT token and look for any missing or duplicate claims as specified in the error description.
2. **Validate Token Format**: Ensure that the token structure follows the correct format required by the issuer.
3. **Check Signature Verification**: Verify that the token is successfully passing the signature validation by the issuer.

#### Common Issues:
1. **Missing Claims**: The token may lack essential claims like `nonce`, `sub`, or others mentioned in the error message.
2. **Claims Mismatch**: The values in the token's claims may not match the expected values.
3. **Invalid Issuer or Audience**: The token may be issued by an unexpected issuer or intended for a different audience.
4. **Expired Token**: The token may be outside its valid time range.
5. **Improper Token Format**: The structure of the token might not comply with the standards.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Correct Token Claims**:
   - If a claim is missing, ensure it is added as per the issuer's requirements.
   - If there is a mismatch, correct the values to align with what the issuer expects.

2. **Issuer and Audience Verification**:
   - Verify if the issuer and audience values in the token match the expected values.
   - Check if the token's intended use aligns with the service it is trying to access.

3. **Time Range and Token Format**:
   - Ensure the token is not expired and falls within its valid time period.
   - Validate the token format to adhere to the standards set by the issuer.

4. **Signature Validation**:
   - If the error mentions failed signature verification, investigate the reason for the failure.
   - Verify the token's signature against the public key provided by the issuer.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- **Token Revocation**: If all checks fail, consider revoking the current token and requesting a new one from the issuer.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Keep a log of token validation attempts and errors for troubleshooting and analysis.
- **Security Considerations**: Validate all tokens securely to prevent unauthorized access.

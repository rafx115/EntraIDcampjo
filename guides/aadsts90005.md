# AADSTS90005: InvalidRequestWithMultipleRequirements - Unable to complete the request. The request isn't valid because the identifier and login hint can't be used together.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS90005

The AADSTS90005 error indicates that there is an invalid request caused by multiple conflicting requirements, specifically that the identifier (like username or email) and the login hint (details passed to the authentication flow) cannot be used simultaneously. Here’s a comprehensive troubleshooting guide to resolve this issue.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Review Error Message:**
   - Take note of the full error message received along with the error code AADSTS90005. Ensure you save any correlation ID provided to help with further investigation.

2. **Identify Request Context:**
   - Determine the context of the request: Are you using an API, a web application, or a mobile application? The method of authentication can affect the parameters being sent.

3. **Check User Input:**
   - Verify any user inputs, such as usernames or emails, to ensure they’re correctly formatted and don’t contain any unexpected characters or spaces.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Conflicting Identifier and Login Hint:**
   - The most common cause is passing both an identifier (e.g., email or user ID) and a login hint in the authentication request, which causes a conflict.

2. **Misconfiguration in Application Registration:**
   - Conflicts may arise from incorrect configurations in the Azure AD application registration, such as redirect URIs or permissions.

3. **Outdated SDK or Libraries:**
   - Using outdated libraries or SDKs may not properly handle requests, leading to unexpected errors.

4. **Scope Issues:**
   - The scopes requested during authentication may conflict with the identifier provided.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Check the Authentication Request:**
   - Inspect the authentication request being made. Ensure that you are not sending both the `username` as an identifier and a `login_hint`. Choose one to use based on your requirement.
   
   Example of a correct configuration:
   - **Use only identifier:** If you’re using the user’s identifier, include this:
     ```json
     {
       "email": "user@example.com"
     }
     ```
   - **Use only login hint:** If you prefer the login hint, it should look like:
     ```json
     {
       "login_hint": "user@example.com"
     }
     ```

2. **Update Application Configuration:**
   - Visit your Azure portal, navigate to **Azure Active Directory > App registrations > Your Application**, and review the configured settings, ensuring that any required identifiers match the requested parameters.

3. **Update Libraries:**
   - Ensure that you are using the latest version of any SDKs or libraries related to Azure Active Directory authentication. Check release notes for any breaking changes.

4. **Debugging and Logs:**
   - Use any logging or debugging tools in your development environment to track the requests and responses. Look for the correlation ID provided in the error message in Azure’s logs for more details.

5. **Test the Request Flow:**
   - After making adjustments, conduct tests to confirm the error no longer appears for various user inputs.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Ensure that your application properly handles session management and user authentication states. Conflicts can arise if the authenticated state is improperly managed.
- It may be helpful to clear any cookies or cache pertaining to the application if previously successful requests are now returning this error.

- Document the exact configuration settings in Azure AD you have made for your applications, including redirect URIs and API permissions.

Certainly! Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide for addressing the AADSTS90005 error code, specifically tailored for the scenario described.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS90005 Error

#### Error Summary
**Error Code:** AADSTS90005  
**Description:** InvalidRequestWithMultipleRequirements - Unable to complete the request. The request isn't valid because the identifier and login hint can't be used together.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Review the Error Context:**
   - Identify the application and context in which the error occurred.
   - Determine if the error occurred during a specific action, such as signing in or acquiring tokens.

2. **Check Input Parameters:**
   - Examine the request parameters being sent during the authentication process. Look specifically for the identifier (such as an email or username) and the login hint.
   - Ensure that you clearly understand the exact values provided and their roles.

3. **Reproduce the issue:**
   - Attempt to reproduce the error under controlled conditions. If you can replicate the problem, take note of the exact steps taken and parameters used.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Conflicting Identifiers:**
   - The request may include both an identifier (like a user principal name) and a login hint. Azure Active Directory does not support using both simultaneously for authentication.

2. **Malformed Requests:**
   - The request body or parameters are formed incorrectly, possibly due to incorrect application configuration or code.

3. **Application Configuration:**
   - The application registered in Azure AD may not be properly configured to support the authentication request being made.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Correct the Request Parameters:**
   - If both an identifier and a login hint are being sent, choose one. Decide whether you will send the identifier (username or email) or the login hint, but not both.
   - In your login request, include only the required parameters to avoid contradictory information.

2. **Check Application Registration:**
   - Go to the Azure portal and navigate to Azure Active Directory.
   - Ensure that your application registration settings (like redirect URIs and API permissions) are configured correctly, and ensure tokens are requested correctly.

3. **Validate User Input:**
   - Make sure that any user input, especially email addresses or usernames, is valid and adheres to expected formats.

4. **Review Authentication Flow:**
   - Confirm that the authentication flow being used (e.g., authorization code flow, implicit flow) is appropriate for your application's requirements.

5. **Consult Documentation:**
   - Review Microsoft's official documentation on [Authentication Scenarios for Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios).

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Token Caching:** If the issue persists after changes are made, clear any cached tokens or session information that might affect subsequent requests.
- **Testing Environments:** If you're testing in different environments or tenants, ensure youâ€™re consistent with your applications' configuration in each environment.

### Documentation for Guidance
- [Azure AD Authentication Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)
- [Common Azure Active Directory Authentication Scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-desktop-overview)
- [Understand Common Azure AD Error Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aad-error-codes)

### Advice for Data Collection
If the issue requires further investigation, gather relevant logs and network traces:

1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - Check the Windows Event Viewer on the affected client machine for any warnings or errors related to authentication.

2. **Network Traces (NetTrace):**
   - Use tools like Fiddler or Network Monitor to capture HTTP requests and responses to see the exact parameters being sent and how the server is responding.
   - Pay attention to the headers and body of the requests, as they can provide insight into any discrepancies.

3. **Fiddler:**
   - If using Fiddler, make sure to capture HTTPS traffic to see detailed authentication requests. Filter traffic if necessary to focus on Azure AD calls.

### Conclusion
By following this troubleshooting guide, you will be equipped with the necessary steps to diagnose and resolve the AADSTS90005 error effectively. Make sure to act on each step methodically to ensure thorough examination and correction of the issues leading to this error.

## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS120015

#### Description
Error code AADSTS120015 indicates that a "PasswordChangeADAdminActionRequired" occurs primarily when a user attempts to access Azure Active Directory (AAD) applications or services and their password has expired or requires an administrative action to reset.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify the User**: Confirm which user is experiencing the error.
2. **Check the Context**: Note the time when the error occurred and any specific applications or services being accessed.
3. **Verify Connectivity**: Ensure that the user has a stable internet connection.
4. **Check User Account Status**: Look into the user's account status in the Azure AD portal (e.g., is the account active?).

### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **Expired Password**: The user’s password is expired and requires a change.
2. **Administrative Action Needed**: The user's account is in a state that requires attention from an administrator (e.g., overdue password reset, account locked).
3. **Account Policy Changes**: Recent group policy changes that affect password requirements or expirations assigned to the user.
4. **Password Policy Enforcement**: Divergence between Azure AD and on-premises Active Directory policies regarding password strength and change intervals.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Admin User Action**:
   - **Reset User Password**:
     - Log in to the Azure portal.
     - Navigate to Azure Active Directory.
     - Go to "Users" and find the affected user.
     - Click on the user account and choose to reset the password.
     - Ensure the "Require change of password on next login" option is checked if applicable.
   
2. **User Password Change**:
   - If the user can access their account but is facing issues due to an expired password:
     - Instruct them to change their password using the self-service password reset feature.
     - Ensure policies are configured for self-service.

3. **Check Accounting Policies**:
   - Review and confirm the password policies configured in Azure AD and any relevant on-premises policies.
   - Adjust as necessary to ensure alignment.

4. **Monitor for Sync Issues**:
   - If the user is synced from an on-premises Active Directory, ensure that synchronization is functioning without errors.
   - Use Azure AD Connect to check the synchronization status.

5. **Test User’s Login**:
   - After correcting the password, have the user attempt to log in again.
   - If the issue persists, check for any additional logon issues specific to the application being used.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: If MFA is required, ensure that it is properly configured for the user after the password change.
- **Security Defaults**: Review security defaults that may enforce strict policies on passwords and authentication attempts.
- **User Role and Group Membership**: Verify that the user has the necessary roles and group memberships that grant access to the necessary resources.

### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**: 
  - Check the Event Viewer on the client machine for related errors: 
    - Path: `Windows Logs -> Application` and `Windows Logs -> Security`
- **Network Trace (NetTrace)**:
  - Capture a network trace during the login attempt for analysis of network calls to Azure AD.
- **Fiddler**:
  - Use Fiddler to monitor HTTP(s) traffic during the login attempts, which can help identify issues with calls to Azure AD.

With these steps, you should be able to troubleshoot and resolve the AADSTS120015 issue effectively. If issues persist, consider escalating to Microsoft support for further assistance.

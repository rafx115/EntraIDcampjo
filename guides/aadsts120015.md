## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Below is a comprehensive troubleshooting guide for the error code **AADSTS120015** with the description **PasswordChangeADAdminActionRequired**.

### Troubleshooting Guide: AADSTS120015 - PasswordChangeADAdminActionRequired

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify the User**: Confirm the specific user account that is encountering the error.
2. **Check Error Context**: Determine whether this error occurs during a password change action in applications such as Microsoft 365, Azure AD, or third-party applications.
3. **Review Event Logs**: If feasible, check any relevant logs in Azure AD or the application in question to gather more context around the error.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error
This error typically occurs when:
- The user's password must be changed due to policy requirements (e.g., expired password, password reset required by admin).
- The account is linked to a service that enforces additional security measures, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- There are mismatches in synchronization settings between on-premises Active Directory and Azure AD.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Check Password Expiration Policy**:
   - Log into the Azure portal as an administrator.
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Users** > **All Users**.
   - Find the affected user and check their password status (active, enabled, password expired).

2. **Force Password Change**:
   - Have the user change their password manually:
     - Go to the Microsoft 365 login page or Azure portal sign-in.
     - Select ‘Forgot password?’ or ‘Change your password’.
     - Follow the prompts to set a new password.
   - Additionally, as an admin, you can reset their password from the Azure portal.

3. **Check for Conditional Access Policies**:
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Conditional Access**.
   - Check if there are policies applied that may require users to change their password.

4. **Review Sign-in Restrictions**:
   - Ensure that the user does not have sign-in restrictions that could be causing the account to be flagged as needing attention.

5. **Sync with On-Premises Active Directory**:
   - If applicable, check whether there are issues with Azure AD Connect:
     - Ensure synchronization is working correctly.
     - Check whether there are any password writeback issues from Azure AD to on-prem AD.
   - Use **Azure AD Connect Health** to monitor and diagnose sync issues.
  
6. **Contact AD Administrator**:
   - If none of the above resolves the issue, escalate to your Active Directory administrator for assistance, particularly if they need to reset policies relevant to the user's account.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Always ensure that the Azure AD account is up to date regarding security baseline requirements such as MFA and self-service password reset (SSPR) setups.
- Be aware of the Password Protection policies configured that might be causing conflict during the password change process.
- Periodically review user accounts for compliance with security guidelines.

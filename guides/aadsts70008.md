## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide: AADSTS70008 - ExpiredOrRevokedGrant

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Confirm the Error Code:**
   Ensure that the error code is indeed AADSTS70008, indicating an issue with an expired or revoked refresh token.

2. **Check Token Issuance Date:**
   Identify the exact date when the refresh token causing the error was issued (referred to as XXX), as this will provide context on its expiration timeline.

#### Common Issues:
- **Long Periods of Inactivity:** Refresh tokens are designed to expire after a certain period of inactivity for security reasons.
- **Manual Revocation:** The token may have been manually revoked by the user or the application.
- **Rotation Policy:** If the token renewal process or token rotation policy is not correctly configured, it can lead to this error.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Verify Token Inactivity:**
   Check the time elapsed since the refresh token was last used to confirm if it has indeed expired due to inactivity.

2. **Attempt Token Refresh:**
   If the original token is still valid, try refreshing it using the appropriate mechanism provided by your authentication service.

3. **Manually Reauthenticate:**
   If the token is expired, prompt the user to re-authenticate to generate a new refresh token.

4. **Review Token Management Policies:**
   Evaluate the token expiration and rotation policies within your authentication setup to ensure they align with security best practices.

5. **Implement Automated Token Renewal:**
   Set up automated processes to regularly refresh tokens to prevent expiration due to inactivity.

6. **Communicate with Users:**
   Educate end-users on the importance of periodic re-authentication and the implications of expired refresh tokens.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- Regularly monitor the token expiration status to proactively address any potential issues.
- Ensure that all application components are updating tokens as required to maintain secure access.
- Review any relevant system logs or audit trails for insights into token usage and expiration patterns.

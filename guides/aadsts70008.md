## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS70008

Error Code: **AADSTS70008**  
Description: **ExpiredOrRevokedGrant - The refresh token has expired due to inactivity. The token was issued on XXX and was inactive for a certain amount of time.**

This error typically occurs when an application attempts to obtain a new access token using a refresh token that is no longer valid due to inactivity or expiration. Here’s a comprehensive troubleshooting guide to identify and resolve this issue.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify the Context of the Error**:
   - Determine which application is generating the error.
   - Gather user details including the time of the error and the specific actions they were trying to perform.

2. **Check the Time Frame**:
   - Note the time the error occurred and compare it with the current time and the issue expiration policy.

3. **Token Information**:
   - Review the tokens being used (access and refresh tokens) to check their issuance and expiration times.

4. **Review Application Logs**:
   - Look at the application logs for any additional error messages or warnings that occurred around the same time.

### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **Inactivity**: The refresh token has not been used to request new access tokens within the allowed inactivity period.
2. **Policy Settings**: Azure AD policy settings may limit the lifetime of tokens, causing them to expire sooner than expected.
3. **User Sign-out**: If a user signs out of the application, existing refresh tokens are invalidated.
4. **Revoked Tokens**: Tokens may be revoked explicitly for security reasons or due to configuration changes in Azure AD.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Re-authentication**:
   - Have the user sign out and then sign back into the application to generate new access and refresh tokens.

2. **Check Token Lifetimes**:
   - Review and modify the application’s token lifetime settings in Azure AD if required:
     - Go to Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > App Registrations > Your Application > Token Configuration.
     - Adjust the "Refresh Token" and "Access Token" lifetime settings if needed.

3. **Increase Activity**:
   - Educate users about the importance of regularly interacting with the application to prevent inactivity expiration.
  
4. **Monitor and Review Security**:
   - Look for any conditional access policies or security configurations that might affect token issuance and validity.
   - Configure proper error handling in the application to gracefully handle token expiration scenarios.

5. **Create Custom Token Management**:
   - Implement token management logic within the application to proactively handle token refresh scenarios without user intervention when tokens are nearing expiration.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Token Management Best Practices**: Implementing better token management and user notification strategies can help reduce scenarios of expired refresh tokens.
- **Inactivity Monitoring**: Consider app-level monitoring to check for user inactivity, allowing for token renewal prompts before expiration.
- **Secure Token Storage**: Ensure that refresh tokens are securely stored to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.

### Advice for Data Collection

To gather useful diagnostics data, leverage the following tools:

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - On the server where your application is running, access Event Viewer and look for Application and System logs to capture relevant errors or warnings.

2. **Network Tracing**:
   - Use **NetTrace** or **Fiddler** to monitor and log network traffic for your application. Check outgoing calls to Azure AD for any abnormal responses, especially around token exchanges.

3. **Fiddler Setup**:
   - Configure Fiddler to capture traffic from the application, focusing on interactions with Azure AD endpoints during token requests.

4. **Logging in Code**:
   - Implement comprehensive logging within your application to capture error messages, stack traces, and responses from Azure AD.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively diagnose and resolve issues related to the AADSTS70008 error code.

# AADSTS900432: Confidential Client isn't supported in Cross Cloud request.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS900432

The error code AADSTS900432 indicates that a "Confidential Client isn't supported in Cross Cloud request." This typically means that your application is attempting to authenticate against Azure Active Directory (AAD) but is encountering a configuration issue due to cloud service mismatches. Below is a detailed guide to troubleshooting this error.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify the Application Type**:
   - Confirm whether your application is a confidential client (like a web app or service) or a public client (like a mobile or desktop app).

2. **Check the Azure Subscription and Tenant**:
   - Verify that the application is registered in the correct Azure Active Directory tenant associated with your subscription.

3. **Examine the Cloud Environment**:
   - Confirm that you are using the appropriate Azure AD cloud. Azure has multiple clouds (e.g., Azure Public, Azure China, Azure Germany, and Azure Government). Ensure that your application is configured for the correct environment.

4. **Review Application Configuration**:
   - Navigate to the Azure portal and check your application registration settings, including redirect URIs, permissions, and certificates/secrets.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Incorrect Tenant Context**:
   - Using a tenant from one Azure environment while trying to authenticate with service endpoints from a different environment.

2. **Cloud Mismatch**:
   - Attempting to access resources across different Azure clouds where confidentiality and compatibility are not supported.

3. **Missing or Incorrect Credentials**:
   - Misconfiguration in authentication credentials, such as client Id, secret, or certificate.

4. **API Permissions**:
   - API permissions that are not properly granted or consented to for the app type being used.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify Cloud Environment**:
   - Check if your application is pointing to the correct Azure endpoint for the intended cloud:
     - Azure Public: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}`
     - Azure China: `https://login.chinacloudapi.cn/{tenant}`
     - Azure Germany: `https://login.cloud.gov.de/{tenant}`
     - Azure Government: `https://login.microsoftonline.us/{tenant}`

2. **Reconfigure Application Registration**:
   - Ensure that the application is registered in the correct Azure AD tenant.
   - Update the application settings to point to the correct URL for your cloud.

3. **Ensure Correct Grant Types**:
   - Make sure that you are utilizing appropriate grant types for your application. Confidential clients typically utilize authorization code or client credentials flow.

4. **Check API Permissions**:
   - Go to your app registration in Azure AD and ensure all necessary API permissions are correctly set and consented for your application.

5. **Use Proper Authentication Libraries**:
   - Make sure to use Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) or Azure AD Authentication Library (ADAL) rather than legacy libraries not supported in cross-cloud scenarios.

6. **Re-register App if Necessary**:
   - If configuration issues persist, consider unregistering and registering the application again in the correct Azure AD.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- If your application needs to access resources across different Azure clouds, it may require a redesign or different configurations that comply with Azure's limitations on cross-cloud interactions.
- Regularly review your application’s authentication and authorization flows and ensure that language and platform-specific libraries are being updated to the latest versions.

#### Documentation for Guidance

- Refer to the following official Microsoft documentation:
  - [Register an application with the Microsoft Identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)
  - [Overview of the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/overview)
  - [Use the Azure AD app registration portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-apps)

#### Advice for Data Collection

If you continue to face this issue, it may be helpful to collect logs and traces to further diagnose the problem:

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Check logs in the Event Viewer on your machine for any related errors that may provide more insight into the application’s behavior.

2. **Network Tracing (NetTrace)**:
   - Use tools like Microsoft Network Monitor or Wireshark to view the network traffic and confirm that the communications with Azure endpoints are being routed correctly.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Use Fiddler to capture HTTP/HTTPS traffic and verify that the requests sent to Azure AD are configured correctly and to analyze the responses for detailed error information.

By following these steps and using the appropriate resources, you should be able to troubleshoot and resolve the AADSTS900432 error effectively.

# AADSTS900432: Confidential Client isn't supported in Cross Cloud request.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS900432: "Confidential Client isn't supported in Cross Cloud request"

#### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps
When encountering the AADSTS900432 error, follow these initial steps to diagnose the situation:

1. **Check the Environment**:
   - Ensure you're aware of the specific environment you are working in (e.g., Azure AD, Azure Government, etc.).
   - Determine whether your application is trying to access resources in multiple Azure clouds (e.g., Azure Public vs. Azure Government).

2. **Review Application Configuration**:
   - Inspect the application registration settings in Azure Active Directory.
   - Verify the client ID, client secret, and redirect URIs.

3. **Evaluate Authentication Flow**:
   - Identify if you're using the correct authentication method for your client (confidential vs. public).
   - Check if the authentication flow used corresponds with the application type (e.g., authorization code flow, client credentials flow).

4. **Check for Dependencies**:
   - Determine if any third-party libraries or SDKs in use have specific configurations or limitations regarding cloud environments.

#### 2. Common Issues that Cause this Error
The AADSTS900432 error can arise due to several common issues, including:

- Misconfiguration of the application in Azure AD.
- An incorrect or unsupported authentication flow for the selected Azure cloud.
- Attempting to use a confidential client application to interact with a service across different Azure clouds.
- Network or firewall restrictions that block requests between different Azure environments.

#### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
To resolve the AADSTS900432 error, follow these strategies:

1. **Validate Application Registration**:
   - Go to the Azure portal and navigate to "Azure Active Directory" > "App registrations".
   - Select your application and ensure it is registered correctly. Pay special attention to the following:
     - `Redirect URIs`: Confirm they correspond with the environmental endpoints.
     - `Client secret` validity: Ensure it has not expired and is properly set up.

2. **Ensure Correct Authentication Flow**:
   - If using a confidential client, ensure that you are using the client credentials flow or proper authorization code flow.
   - Review Microsoft Docs to determine expected flows based on your application type.

3. **Check Cloud Compatibility**:
   - Confirm that you are not inadvertently switching between Azure clouds in your requests.
   - Each Azure cloud has its own Azure AD tenant, and cross-cloud requests may not be supported for confidential clients.

4. **Adjust Networking Configurations**:
   - If operating behind proxies or firewalls, ensure that your requests to Azure services are allowed through. Consult with your network administrator if necessary.

5. **Test and Validate**:
   - After making adjustments, execute your authentication strategy again to see if the error persists.
   - Monitor the logs for any further details or related errors that might provide insight into remaining issues.

#### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Limitations of Confidential Clients**: Understand that confidential clients are less flexible when it comes to cross-cloud requests compared to public clients.
- **Service Account Use**: If cross-cloud access is essential, consider whether using service accounts or transitioning to a public client could be an alternative approach.

#### 5. Documentation for Guidance
The following Microsoft documentation pages can provide further reference and step-by-step guidance:

- [Azure AD Application Registration Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)
- [Confidential Client Applications in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-daemon-acquire-token)
- [Understanding Cross Cloud Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc)

#### 6. Testing Documentation Reachability
Make sure the documentation links are active and reachable by following these steps:
- Open a web browser and navigate to each link provided above.
- Make sure there are no errors like 404 or other HTTP errors.

#### 7. Advice for Data Collection
When gathering data for troubleshooting:

- **Log API Calls**: Capture requests being sent to Azure AD, including URLs, headers, and payloads.
- **Error Messages**: Document complete error messages, including error codes, timestamps, and any other relevant context surrounding the error.
- **Network Logs**: If applicable, check firewall or proxy logs for any potential blocks or issues with outgoing requests.

This structured troubleshooting guide should help you effectively diagnose and resolve the AADSTS900432 error related to cross-cloud requests with confidential clients.

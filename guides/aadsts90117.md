### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS90117: InvalidRequestInput


#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:

1. **Verify Error Code**: Confirm that the error code displayed is indeed
   AADSTS90117.
2. **Check Context**: Understand where the error occurred (e.g., during login,
   access request, token exchange).
3. **Review Logs**: Examine any logs or error messages provided by the
   application or authentication service.


#### Common Issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Format**: The request parameters may not be in the correct
   format or missing required parameters.
2. **Expired Token**: The provided access token or refresh token may have
   expired.
3. **Invalid Client Configuration**: Issues with the client application
   configurations like redirect URLs or client secret.
4. **Mismatched Data**: Data sent in the request does not match the expected
   format or data stored in the service.
5. **Network Connectivity**: Connectivity issues preventing the proper exchange
   of data between client and authentication service.


#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **Verify Request Inputs**:

   * Check that all required parameters are included in the request.

   * Ensure data formats (e.g., URLs, tokens) are accurate.

2. **Check Token Expiry**:

   * If using access tokens, make sure they are not expired. Obtain a new token

     if needed.

3. **Review Client Configuration**:

   * Verify that client ID, redirect URIs, and client secrets are correctly

     configured and match the service settings.

4. **Debug Request Data**:

   * Use tools like Fiddler or Wireshark to inspect the request data for any

     anomalies.

5. **Refresh Token if Necessary**:

   * If using refresh tokens, try refreshing the token and retry the request.

6. **Monitor Network Connectivity**:
   * Ensure that there are no network issues impacting the communication between

     the client and authentication service.


#### Additional Notes or Considerations:


* **Token Tracking**: Implement robust token management practices to track token

  lifecycles and renewals.

* **API Rate Limits**: Make sure the request frequency does not exceed service

  limits.

* **Review Service Documentation**: Consult the service provider's documentation

  for specific troubleshooting steps related to AADSTS90117 errors.

* **Testing Environment**: Test changes in a non-production environment to avoid

  disruptions to live systems.

By following these steps and considering the common issues listed, you should be
able to diagnose and resolve the AADSTS90117: InvalidRequestInput error
effectively.

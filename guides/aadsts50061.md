### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **Invalid or Missing Logout URL:**
   - The configured Logout URL for the application is incorrect or not specified in the redirect URI settings.

2. **Inconsistent Client Configuration:**
   - Issues with client secret or ID configuration can cause sign-out requests to fail.

3. **Session Cookies:**
   - Corrupted or expired session cookies can hinder the sign-out process.

4. **Network Issues:**
   - Lack of connectivity between the client application and AAD services.

5. **Cross-origin Issues:**
   - If the logout request is sent from an unauthorized domain, the request may be considered invalid.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Check Application Registration:**
   - Navigate to the Azure Portal:
     - Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations**.
     - Select your application and verify the **Redirect URIs** for logout are correctly configured.

2. **Validate the Logout URL:**
   - Review the logout URL defined in your application and ensure it matches the one configured in Azure AD.
   - It should be properly formatted and accessible from the user's browser.

3. **Review Application Permissions:**
   - Ensure that the application has the necessary permissions for sign-out operations.
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations** > Select application > **API permissions**.

4. **Check Session State:**
   - Clear browser cookies and cache to ensure that stale sessions do not affect the logout process.
   - Test logout across different browsers to eliminate browser-specific issues.

5. **Correct Cross-Origin Issues:**
   - Ensure that your application is correctly configured to allow cross-origin requests if needed.

6. **Implement Logging:**
   - Enable logging in your application to capture more detailed error messages during the sign-out process.

7. **Monitor Network Traffic:**
   - Use tools like Fiddler or browser developer tools to inspect network requests and responses for the sign-out operation to identify malformed requests.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Session Management:** Review the session management strategy within your application. Ensure it properly handles session expiry and cleanup.
- **Multiple Sign-In Accounts:** If users are logged in with multiple accounts, inconsistencies might arise. Consider advising users to sign out all accounts if the issue persists.
- **Testing Environments:** If you're in a testing environment, ensure that it mirrors the production setup with valid configuration values.

### Advice for Data Collection

- **Event Viewer Logs:**
  - Check Windows Event Viewer for Application and System logs related to your application that might provide insights on failures during sign-out.

- **Network Trace:**
  - Use network tracing tools like **NetTrace** or Fiddler. Capture the entire sequence of requests during a sign-out operation to analyze HTTP responses from AAD.

- **Fiddler Usage:**
  - Open Fiddler before reproducing the error. Look for any 4xx or 5xx status codes in the logs that could indicate request issues.

# AADSTS50088: Limit on telecom MFA calls reached. Please try again in a few minutes.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS50088

#### Overview
The error code AADSTS50088 indicates that a user has reached the limit for telecommunications-based Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) calls. Azure Active Directory (AAD) has imposed this limit to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Understand the Context**:
   - Gather information about the user encountering the issue:
     - User's account and role (admin, user, etc.).
     - When the error occurred (time and date).
     - The method used for MFA (call, SMS, app).
  
2. **Check User Attempts**:
   - Determine the frequency and number of MFA attempts made by the user in a short period.
   - Count how many call attempts were made and in what time frame.

3. **Review Service Status**:
   - Check the Microsoft Azure service status page to identify any ongoing issues or outages that may contribute to the problem.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **Limit Reached**:
   - The user has exceeded the maximum number of MFA calls allowed in a certain timeframe (limited to a certain number of attempts per minute).

2. **Configuration Issues**:
   - Incorrect configurations in the MFA settings (like trying to use a phone number registered in a service area that does not support calls).

3. **Network Issues**:
   - Temporary network issues may prevent the call from being completed, leading to retry attempts.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Wait and Retry**:
   - Ask the user to wait for at least 10-15 minutes before trying to authenticate again, as this allows the call limit to reset.

2. **Use Alternative MFA Methods**:
   - If immediate access is necessary, instruct the user to try a different method for MFA such as:
     - Using Microsoft Authenticator app for push notifications.
     - Utilizing a different phone number if available.
     - Choosing SMS verification instead of a call.

3. **Check MFA Settings**:
   - Ensure the userâ€™s MFA settings are correctly configured in the Azure portal:
     - Go to Azure AD > Users > Select User > Authentication methods.
     - Verify the users' registered methods and make any necessary adjustments.

4. **Audit Logs**:
   - Access Azure AD and check the sign-in logs:
     - Azure AD > Sign-ins > Search for user
     - Review the logs for any patterns of failed MFA attempts or other relevant errors.

5. **Contact Support**:
   - If the issue persists and significantly affects operations, contact Azure support for deeper investigation.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Frequent Users**: If the user frequently relies on phone call-based MFA, it might be beneficial to encourage adoption of app-based authentication methods, which can alleviate call limits.
- **Workflow Changes**: Organizations may want to periodically review their MFA policies and user communications to ensure clarity during authentication challenges.
- **User Awareness**: Educating users about allowable authentication limits can enhance understanding and reduce frustration during repeated failed attempts.

### Advice for Data Collection
If further troubleshooting is required, data collection through the following systems may aid in diagnosing the problem:
- **Event Viewer Logs**:
  - Collect logs from the Windows Event Viewer, focusing on application and system events that correlate with the time of the issue.
  - Look for any application errors during the attempted MFA calls.

- **Network Traces**:
  - Use `netsh trace start capture=yes` from a command prompt to gather network traces. Review the .etl files afterwards to identify anomalies in network requests related to MFA.

- **Fiddler**:
  - To monitor HTTP/S traffic, Fiddler can be configured to capture the authentication requests and responses which can help identify any issues on the back end.

By collecting logs and traces, you may identify specific patterns or errors leading to the AADSTS50088 error, improving your capability to deliver a permanent solution.

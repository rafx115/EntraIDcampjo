## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS80005: OnPremisePasswordValidatorUnpredictableWebException

**Error Description:**  
AADSTS80005 indicates an unknown error occurred while processing the response from the Authentication Agent. This error is generally related to the handling of authentication requests involving on-premises identity solutions such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) or Azure AD Connect.

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Review Logs:**
   - Check the Azure AD sign-in logs for specific timestamps and account information related to the error.
   - Look at the event viewer on the server running AD FS for any warnings or errors around the time of the failure.

2. **Network Connectivity:**
   - Ensure that the server hosting the Authentication Agent can reach the Azure AD endpoints and does not have any network issues.

3. **Reproduce the Error:**
   - Attempt to reproduce the error using the same credentials and environment to gather more precise conditions under which the error occurs.

### Common Issues that Cause This Error

- **Network Issues:** Firewalls or network security settings may block requests to Azure AD.
- **Authentication Agent Issues:** The On-Premises Authentication Agent might be misconfigured or experiencing issues.
- **Timeouts:** Slow, unreliable network connections can cause timeouts when the Authentication Agent tries to communicate with Azure AD.
- **Proxy Configuration Issues:** If there's a proxy in place, it may not be properly routing requests to Azure AD.
- **AD FS Configuration Issues:** Wrongly configured authentication methods or relying party trusts may lead to issues.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Confirm Network Connectivity:**
   - Use `telnet` to check the connectivity to Azure AD endpoints (e.g. `login.microsoftonline.com`).

2. **Restart the Authentication Agent:**
   - If the Authentication Agent is running on a separate server, restart the service.

3. **Verify Authentication Agent Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the configuration settings for the Authentication Agent are correct.
   - Check that the Agent is running the latest version and is properly registered with Azure AD.

4. **Adjust AD FS Configuration:**
   - Check that there are no issues with your AD FS configuration settings:
     - Login to the AD FS management console.
     - Review the Relying Party Trusts configuration.
     - Verify whether any recent changes were made to the authentication methods.

5. **Increase Timeout Settings:**
   - If applicable, increase any timeout settings in your Authentication Agent or AD FS.

6. **Check for Other Known Issues:**
   - Search in known technical forums or Microsoft’s support articles for any notes on relevant patches or versions that may resolve the issue.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Monitor Traffic:** Use tools like Wireshark or Fiddler to monitor network traffic between the Authentication Agent and Azure AD, which can help in identifying where requests may be failing.
  
- **Testing in Isolation:** If possible, separate the components involved (e.g., test AD FS and the Authentication Agent independently) to isolate where the problem lies.

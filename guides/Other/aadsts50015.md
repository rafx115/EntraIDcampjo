# AADSTS50015: ViralUserLegalAgeConsentRequiredState - The user requires legal age group consent.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The AADSTS50015 error code indicates that a user requires consent for the appropriate legal age group before they can access the desired resources within Azure Active Directory (AAD). This commonly applies to scenarios involving applications that collect or process user data, particularly involving minors.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50015 Error

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify User Impact**: Confirm which user(s) are seeing the error code. Check if it's a specific user or a broader group.
2. **Verify User Info**: Check the users profile in Azure AD to determine their age and if they belong to a legal age group that requires consent. This can be done in the Azure Portal under Azure Active Directory > Users.
3. **Reproduce the Error**: Attempt to replicate the error by signing into the application using the affected user account. Document the exact steps that led to the appearance of the error.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error
1. **User's Legal Age Status**: The user is classified as underage, and your application or service requires parental or guardian consent.
2. **Application Permissions**: The application may require access to certain scopes that need additional consent from users who fall under the age restrictions.
3. **Consent Policies**: Azure AD might have specific policies that govern who can access applications based on age.

#### Step-by-step Resolution Strategies
1. **Check User Profile in Azure AD**:
   - Navigate to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com).
   - Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **Users**.
   - Search for the affected user and review their information, especially the age or birthdate.

2. **Adjust User Consent Settings**:
   - If the user needs permission on an application, review your **Application Registrations**.
   - Under the application settings, ensure that the permissions and consent requirements are legitimate for the user's age.

3. **Review and Update Application Policy**:
   - Check the applications Age Consent policy if its set to require legal guardian consent.
   - Update the settings to allow access for users who are of legal age if appropriate.

4. **Implement Parental or Guardian Consent**:
   - If the user is indeed a minor, you may need to implement a process whereby the parent or guardian can provide consent for data collection or specific actions.

5. **Testing**:
   - After making changes, have the affected user test logging in again to ensure that the error is resolved.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Always involve your compliance team when handling age-related consent policies to ensure you adhere to local laws and regulations regarding data protection and minors (e.g., COPPA in the U.S.).
- Make sure to handle the consent process smoothly, with clear guidance and support for users attempting to provide required permissions.

# AADSTS90008: TokenForItselfRequiresGraphPermission - The user or administrator hasn't consented to use the application. At the minimum, the application requires access to Microsoft Entra ID by specifying the sign-in and read user profile permission.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS90008

#### Error Description
**AADSTS90008** indicates that the user or administrator has not consented to an application that requires access to Microsoft Entra ID, specifically for permissions like *sign-in* and *read user profile*.

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Understand the Context**: Identify the application trying to access Microsoft Entra ID and the permissions it requests.
2. **User or Admin Role**: Determine if the user encountering the error has the correct role (e.g., is the user an admin or a regular user?).
3. **Consent Status**: Check whether the application requires admin consent for the permissions it is requesting.
4. **Review Application Permissions**: Log in to the Azure portal and review the permissions requested by the application.

---

### Common Issues That Cause this Error
1. **Missing User Consent**: The user has not consented to the permissions required by the application.
2. **Admin Consent Needed**: The application requests permissions that require admin consent; the admin has not granted this.
3. **Permissions Misconfiguration**: The application may be misconfigured in Azure AD, requiring different permissions than those granted.
4. **Scope of Authentication**: The application might be using the wrong authentication scope that requires more consent than granted.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

#### Step 1: Check Application Registration
- **Access the Azure Portal**: Sign in to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
- **Navigate to Azure Active Directory**: Select "Azure Active Directory" from the left-hand menu.
- **Find the Application**: Under "App registrations," search for the application that is causing the error.
- **Review API Permissions**: Check if the required permissions (like User.Read for sign-in and read user profile) are listed.

#### Step 2: User Consent for Individual Permissions
- **Grant Consent for Single Permissions**: If the application allows it, the user may be prompted to consent during the login process.
  
#### Step 3: Admin Consent for Required Permissions
- **Grant Admin Consent**:
  - Navigate to **API permissions** of the application.
  - Click on the "Grant admin consent for [Tenant Name]" button if you have the role of an administrator.

#### Step 4: Check User Attributes
- Ensure that the user has the necessary attributes to authenticate. Sometimes, external users or guest accounts may have restrictions.

#### Step 5: Testing Access
- After granting permissions, log in again with the user account to verify if the issue persists.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Consent Policies**: If your organization restricts consent, consult your admin to ensure proper consent policies are in place.
- **Multitenancy**: If the application is multitenant, make sure that the required permissions are granted not just for users in your tenant but across all tenants if necessary.
- **Review Sign-in Logs**: If the problem continues, review the sign-in logs in Azure AD to gather additional insights.

### Advice for Data Collection
1. **Gather User Information**: Collect information about the user account experiencing the error (username, role).
2. **Application ID**: Record the application ID and name that is causing the error.
3. **Error Logs**: Capture error messages and logs from the application where the error occurs.
4. **Consent History**: Maintain a record of when permissions were requested and if they were granted.

By collecting this information, you can more effectively diagnose issues in the future and provide clearer details to technical support if needed.

# AADSTS81009: DesktopSsoAuthorizationHeaderValueWithBadFormat - Unable to validate user's Kerberos ticket.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The AADSTS81009 error indicating "DesktopSsoAuthorizationHeaderValueWithBadFormat - Unable to validate user's Kerberos ticket" typically occurs when there's an issue with the Kerberos authentication process in an Azure Active Directory (AAD) context. Here's a comprehensive troubleshooting guide to resolve this issue.

---

### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps

- **Identify Users Affected**: Determine if the problem is occurring for all users or just specific ones.
  
- **Check Environment**: Verify if the issue occurs on specific devices or across the organization, indicating a broader configuration issue.

- **Review User's Connectivity**: Confirm that the user has an active connection to the domain network, as Kerberos relies on domain connectivity.

- **Update Logs**: Check application or system logs for related errors that might provide more context on the failure.

### 2. Common Issues That Cause This Error

- **Improper Configuration of Service Principal Names (SPNs)**: If SPNs are misconfigured, the Kerberos ticket cannot be validated.

- **Outdated or Missing Kerberos Tickets**: The user's Kerberos tickets might be expired or missing.

- **DNS Misconfiguration**: Kerberos relies heavily on DNS, and any misconfiguration can lead to authentication failures.

- **Local Security Policy Settings**: Wrong settings in local security policy can prevent proper ticket validation.

- **Network Issues**: Firewalls or network configurations can block necessary Kerberos traffic.

### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

#### A. Verify Kerberos Ticket

1. **Open Command Prompt** on the affected user's machine.
2. **Run** the command: `klist`
   - This lists the current Kerberos tickets. Check the validity and expiration times.
3. If no valid tickets exist, or they are expired:
   - Run: `kinit username@DOMAIN.COM` to request a new ticket.

#### B. Check SPN Configuration

1. **Open PowerShell** with administrative privileges.
2. Run: `Get-ADUser -Identity username -Properties ServicePrincipalName`
   - Check if the appropriate SPNs are listed.
3. If necessary, use the command:
   - `Set-ADUser -Identity username -Add @{ServicePrincipalName="http/yourapp.domain.com"}` to add or correct the SPN.

#### C. Validate DNS Configuration

1. Ping the service host and validate both FQDN and short name resolve correctly.
   - Use `nslookup` to check DNS resolution: `nslookup yourapp.domain.com`
2. Ensure necessary DNS records (A, PTR) are correctly set up.

#### D. Check Local Security Policy

1. Open **Local Security Policy** (`secpol.msc`).
2. Navigate to **Local Policies > User Rights Assignment**.
3. Verify settings around "Access this computer from the network" and "Deny access to this computer from the network" do not block the user.

#### E. Network Traffic and Firewall

1. Ensure firewall settings allow traffic for Kerberos (UDP/TCP 88).
2. Use tools like `Wireshark` to monitor and analyze network traffic during authentication attempts.

### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Kerberos is sensitive to time synchronization**. Ensure that time across all devices (users' machines, servers) is synchronized with a reliable time source.
- Consider running `net time /set` to synchronize time on affected machines.
- Consider group policies that might affect Kerberos functionality.

### 5. Documentation for Further Guidance

- For in-depth guidance, Microsoft provides resources on Kerberos authentication: 
  - [Understanding Azure Active Directory Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)
  - [Active Directory Kerberos Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/kerberos-authentication-in-windows-server)

### 6. Testing Documentation Accessibility

- Confirm that the links to documentation are reachable by clicking on each or accessing them through a browser. For instance:
  - [Understanding Azure Active Directory Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)
  - [Active Directory Kerberos Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/kerberos-authentication-in-windows-server)

### 7. Advice for Data Collection

- When raising the issue with support teams, collect the following:
  - Overview of the users and machines affected.
  - Logs from Event Viewer that may relate to Kerberos failure (Security Log).
  - Outputs from the command line (e.g., `klist`, SPN checks).
  - Network traffic captures might also provide helpful context.

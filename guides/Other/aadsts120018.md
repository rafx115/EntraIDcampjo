2. **Examine Error Message**:
   - Review the complete error message and context in which it occurred. Check for any additional logging that might indicate more about the failure.

#### Common Issues that Cause this Error

1. **Non-compliance with Password Policies**:
   - The newly selected password may not meet complexity requirements (e.g., length, uppercase letters, special characters).
   - The password may be too similar to the old password or may contain easily guessable parts of the user's profile, such as name or username.

2. **Fuzzy Policy Settings**:
   - The Azure AD tenant might have defined complex fuzzy policies that restrict certain passwords from being used.

3. **Recent Password Change**:
   - The user may be attempting to set a password too soon after a previous change.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Review Password Requirements**:
   - Check the specific organizationÂ’s password policy. Generally, passwords should:
     - Be at least 8 characters long.
     - Include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.
     - Not contain easily guessable information.

2. **Choose a Stronger Password**:
   - Instruct the user to select a new password that is significantly different from their previous password and follows the established complexity requirements.

3. **Use Password Generators**:
   - Recommend the use of password generation tools or services to create complex passwords.

4. **Test Password Change**:
   - Have the user attempt to change their password again after selecting a new password that adheres to the guidelines.

5. **Consider Password History Policies**:
   - If the user changes passwords frequently, ensure they are aware of any history limitations preventing them from reusing previous passwords.

6. **Contact IT Support**:
   - If the error persists, enlist the support of the IT team to investigate any potential tenant-wide policies affecting password changes.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Audit Administrative Access**: Ensure that password policies are set correctly in Azure AD by checking settings with an administrator account.
- **Consider MFA**: Employ Multi-Factor Authentication for enhanced security measures if not already in place.

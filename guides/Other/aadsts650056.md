# AADSTS650056: Misconfigured application. This could be due to one of the following: the client has not listed any permissions for '{name}' in the requested permissions in the client's application registration. Or, the admin has not consented in the tenant. Or, check the application identifier in the request to ensure it matches the configured client application identifier. Or, check the certificate in the request to ensure it's valid. Please contact your admin to fix the configuration or consent on behalf of the tenant. Client app ID: {ID}. Please contact your admin to fix the configuration or consent on behalf of the tenant.


## Troubleshooting Steps
# Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS650056

The AADSTS650056 error indicates a misconfiguration in the Azure Active Directory (AAD) application settings. Below is a structured troubleshooting guide to help you identify and resolve the issue.

## Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check the Error Message:** Read the details in the error message carefully. It often provides information about specific issues, such as permissions, consent, or identifier mismatches.
  
2. **Identify the Client Application:** Note the client application ID given in the error message: `{ID}`. This will help you in identifying the application registration in Azure.

## Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Missing Permissions:** The application has not been granted permissions in the Azure portal that match what the user or application is requesting.

2. **Lack of Tenant Admin Consent:** The necessary permissions have been granted but not consented to by an administrator of the Azure tenant.

3. **Incorrect Application Identifier:** The application ID used in the request does not match the registered application in Azure.

4. **Invalid or Expired Certificate:** If the application uses a certificate for authentication, it may be invalid or expired.

5. **Misconfigured Azure AD App Registration:** The app may not be properly configured regarding redirect URIs, secrets, allowed scopes, etc.

## Step-by-step Resolution Strategies

### Step 1: Check Application Registration

- Go to the **Azure portal** and navigate to Azure Active Directory.
- Click on **App registrations**.
- Locate your application using the **client app ID** noted above.

### Step 2: Verify Permissions

1. In the application registration, go to the **API permissions** blade.
2. Check if the permissions required by your application are listed. Focus on both **Delegated Permissions** and **Application Permissions** based on your authentication flow.
3. If they are missing, click **Add a permission** to include the necessary permissions.

### Step 3: Admin Consent

1. Verify whether the required permissions have been granted admin consent:
   - If permissions need admin consent, ensure that a tenant admin has gone to the API permissions section and clicked **Grant admin consent for {Your Tenant Name}**.
   
### Step 4: Check Application Identifier

- In the error message, ensure the **client app ID** matches the **Application (client) ID** in the Azure portal registration precisely. If there’s a mismatch, update the request to use the correct ID.

### Step 5: Validate Certificate (if applicable)

1. If your application is using a certificate for authentication, check the **Certificates & Secrets** section of your app registration.
2. Ensure that:
   - The certificate is properly uploaded.
   - The certificate is valid (not expired).
   - The application is using the correct certificate thumbprint in its requests.

## Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Testing After Changes:** After making changes in permissions or configurations, always test if the error persists.
- **Role of Protection Policies:** If there are Conditional Access Policies in play, these might affect access based on device compliance or user risk.

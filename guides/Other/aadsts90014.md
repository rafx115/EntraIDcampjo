#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Review Authentication Code:**
   - Verify that all credentials and fields required for authentication (such as client ID and secret) are being correctly defined and passed.

2. **Check Registration in Azure AD:**
   - Confirm that the application is properly registered in Azure AD. Cross-check:
     - The Redirect URI is correctly set up.
     - The app has the necessary API permissions.
     - Required fields are not left blank in the registration form.

3. **Inspect API Calls:**
   - Examine the requests to Azure AD for missing fields. Ensure that all required fields are populated in the token request.

4. **Test the User Account:**
   - Ensure the user account attempting to authenticate is properly set up, including being assigned to the right application roles.

5. **Review Claims Mapping:**
   - If using an identity provider to authenticate, ensure that all required claims are being sent correctly during the process.

6. **Check Service Configuration:**
   - Ensure the service or application that requires authentication has been configured correctly to handle the OAuth / OpenID Connect flow.

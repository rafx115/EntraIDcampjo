# AADSTS7000218: The request body must contain the following parameter: 'client_assertion' or 'client_secret'.


## Troubleshooting Steps
**Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS7000218 Error**

### Overview:
The AADSTS7000218 error indicates that a request to Azure Active Directory (AAD) is missing a required parameter: either `client_assertion` or `client_secret`. This error typically arises during authentication processes such as OAuth 2.0 flows.

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Identify the context**:
   - Determine when the error occurs: During sign-in, token acquisition, or API calls.
   - Note which application is attempting to authenticate.

2. **Review the request**:
   - Check the request payload being sent to Azure AD and confirm that it includes either `client_assertion` (JWT) or `client_secret`.

3. **Check logs**:
   - Review any logs related to the application to gain more insight into what the request looked like when it failed.

### Common Issues that Cause This Error:
1. **Missing parameters**: The request may be missing necessary parameters.
2. **Incorrect client ID or tenant information**: The request may be directed to the wrong tenant or using the wrong application ID.
3. **Confidential client incomplete configuration**: The application is expected to use `client_secret` but it is not configured correctly.
4. **Invalid redirect URI**: Redirect URIs must match what is registered in Azure AD.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **Review Client Application Registration**:
   - Go to the Azure Portal and navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations.
   - Ensure that your application is registered correctly and note the `Application (client) ID` and `Directory (tenant) ID`.

2. **Verify Application Permissions**:
   - Under the app registration, check API permissions. Ensure that necessary permissions are granted.

3. **Configure Authentication Settings**:
   - In the app registration settings, check the "Certificates & secrets" section:
     - **Client Secret**: If your application uses a client secret, ensure it is created and copied correctly in your code.
     - **Client Assertion (JWT)**: If your application uses a client assertion, ensure its format is correct and that it is being signed properly.

4. **Ensure Correct Token Request Construction**:
   - Ensure that your token request includes:
     - `client_id`
     - `client_secret` (if configured to use)
     - `client_assertion` (if configured to use)
     - `grant_type`, `scope`, and `redirect_uri` as required.

   Example for using client secret:
   ```plaintext
   POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   client_id={your-client-id}
   scope={scope}
   client_secret={your-client-secret}
   grant_type=client_credentials
   ```

5. **Double-Check the Endpoint**:
   - Ensure that you are targeting the right endpoint for your application's flow (v1.0 or v2.0).

6. **Check for Typos**:
   - Validate that all keys and parameters are correctly spelled and cased, as they are case-sensitive.

### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- If using a confidential client (like a web application) or a daemon application, you must provide a client secret or use a client assertion.
- Be mindful of how secrets are stored in your application code, as hardcoding is not secure practice.

### Documentation Where Steps Can Be Found:
- [Microsoft Identity Platform Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/)
- [Client Credentials Grant in OAuth2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant)
- [Application Registration in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)

### Test Documentation Reachability:
Test the above documentation links in a web browser to ensure they are reachable.

### Advice for Data Collection:
1. **Application Logs**: Capture logs before and after the error occurs, including the full request and response.
2. **Environment Information**: Note the Azure AD tenant, application ID, type of application, and authentication method.
3. **Request Headers/Body**: Collect raw HTTP request and response data to analyze the failure.

By following the steps in this troubleshooting guide, you can systematically address the AADSTS7000218 error and ensure proper configuration and authentication processes for your application.

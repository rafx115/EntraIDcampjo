If you still see issues, contact the app owner or an app admin.


## Troubleshooting Steps
# Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50003 Error Code

**Error Description:** AADSTS50003 - Sign-in failed because of a missing signing key or certificate. This typically indicates that there is no signing key configured in the application.

## Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify the Context:**  
   - Determine when and how the error occurs (e.g., during user sign-in, API request).
   - Note down any additional error messages or context that accompanies AADSTS50003.

2. **Check Signing Key Configuration:**
   - Access the Azure portal and navigate to the App Registration for your application.
   - Verify if a signing key/certificate has been configured.

3. **Review Application Logs:**
   - Look for log entries in the application that might provide additional context about the error.
   - Check Azure AD sign-in logs for entries around the time the error occurred.

4. **Check Environment:**
   - Ensure you're in the correct tenant environment and that the app is allowed to authenticate (check any tenant-specific configurations or policies).

## Common Issues that Cause this Error

- The signing key or certificate required for OAuth validation is not present or incorrectly configured in Azure AD.
- The application registration is incorrectly set up, particularly in the "Authentication" tab.
- Expired signing certificates that have not been renewed.
- Misconfigured permissions or consent that prevents proper authentication.
- The application is misconfigured to use an unsupported authentication method.

## Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

### 1. Verify the Application Registration Configuration:
   - **Login to Azure Portal:** 
     1. Navigate to Azure Active Directory.
     2. Click on "App registrations" and select your application.
   - **Check Certificates & Secrets:**
     1. Go to the "Certificates & Secrets" section.
     2. Ensure there is a valid certificate or client secret configured.
     3. If absent, either create a new client secret under "Client secrets" or upload a new certificate under "Certificates".

### 2. Configure The Necessary Keys:
   - **Create a New Client Secret:**
     1. Under "Certificates & Secrets", click on "New client secret".
     2. Provide a description and set the expiration. 
     3. Copy the generated secret immediately, as it will not be retrievable later.
   - **Upload a Certification:**
     1. If you prefer using certificates, ensure that you upload a valid certificate (typically a .cer file).
     2. Follow necessary guidelines to generate a valid certificate if needed.

### 3. Validate Permissions:
   - **API Permissions:**
     1. Ensure that the required permissions for your application to access Azure features are granted.
     2. Go to "API permissions" and verify the permissions; make sure admin consent has been granted if needed.

### 4. Check for Expired Certificates:
   - Regularly monitor and renew any certificates that are approaching expiration. Azure usually warns you if a key/certificate is nearing expiration.

### 5. Review Authentication Settings:
   - **OAuth 2.0 Settings:**
     1. In the "Authentication" tab, make sure that redirect URIs are correctly configured.
     2. Ensure the "ID tokens" checkbox is enabled for the appropriate platforms and applications.

## Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Development vs. Production:** If this app is in development, ensure the app settings match the production environment, specifically regarding keys and permissions.
- **Error Propagation:** This error can propagate if upstream dependencies or services are also misconfigured.
- **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets:** Always use secure storage for secrets and credentials.

## Advice for Data Collection

- **Error Logs:** Collect logs from the Azure AD and your application during the error occurrence timeframe.
- **User Context:** Capture the user context under which the error was raised (username, roles, etc.).
- **Request Details:** Document any relevant HTTP requests/responses that could show patterns related to the error.
- **Client ID and Tenant ID:** Note the Client ID and Tenant ID of the application in question to help in searching for specific issues related to them.

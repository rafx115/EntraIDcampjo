## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS80010: OnPremisePasswordValidationEncryptionException

This error is associated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) when the Authentication Agent fails to decrypt a password during sign-in attempts.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check the Error Details**: Verify the complete error message for any additional context, including timestamps and user identifiers.

2. **Identify Scope**: Determine if the issue is affecting all users or specific users, as well as whether it's limited to specific applications.

3. **Review Logs**: Check the logs of the Azure AD Connect or the AD FS to pinpoint when the error began occurring and any related warnings or errors.

4. **Service Status**: Ensure that the Azure services, including Azure AD and Azure AD Connect, are operational by visiting the **[Azure Status Page](https://status.azure.com/en-us/status)**.

5. **Network Issues**: Confirm that there are no network connectivity issues between your on-premises environment and Azure AD.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Misconfiguration of the On-Premises Authentication Agent**: If the agent is not correctly configured, it may fail to decrypt the password.

2. **Encryption Key Issues**: Problems with the encryption key used by the Authentication Agent can lead to decryption failures.

3. **Expired or Revoked Certificates**: If the agentâ€™s certificates (used for encryption and secure communication) are expired or revoked.

4. **Change in Account State**: User accounts may be in an invalid state, such as being disabled or deleted.

5. **Software Updates**: Recent updates to the Authentication Agent or Azure AD Connect might have altered configurations.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Review the Authentication Agent Configuration**:
   - Verify the configuration settings of the Authentication Agent.
   - Ensure that the on-premises environment matches the required configurations as per Microsoft guidelines.

2. **Check Encryption Keys**:
   - Confirm that the encryption keys used by the agent are correct and have not been altered or deleted.
   - Compare the keys in the on-premises environment with the ones stored in Azure AD.

3. **Renew or Replace Certificates**:
   - If any certificates are found to be expired, renew or replace them.
   - Ensure the updated certificates are correctly configured on the Authentication Agent.

4. **Reinstall the Authentication Agent**:
   - If problems persist after checking configurations and keys, consider uninstalling and reinstalling the Authentication Agent. 
   - Follow the steps in the official documentation for reinstallation.

5. **Reset User Password**:
   - If the specific user accounts are causing issues, resetting the user password might help resolve some inconsistencies.

6. **Update to Latest Version**:
   - Ensure the Authentication Agent and Azure AD Connect are updated to the latest version.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Ensure that your server has sufficient permissions to perform decryption tasks required by the Authentication Agent.
- Pay attention to any firewall rules or security groups that might inadvertently block traffic between Azure AD and the on-premises Authentication Agent.

#### Documentation for Guidance

- **Azure Active Directory Documentation**: There are various docs available on the Microsoft website.
    - [Authentication Agent Setup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/deploy-authentication-agent)
    - [Install and Configure Azure AD Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-install-new)

- **Troubleshooting Authentication Agents**: See the relevant troubleshooting guides provided by Microsoft.

#### Test Documentation Reachability

Verify that the links provided in the documentation section are working by clicking on them directly. All should lead to the live, official Microsoft documentation pages.

#### Advice for Data Collection

- **Logs**: Collect logs from the Authentication Agent and Azure AD Connect. Look specifically for event IDs or any additional error codes.
- **Time Stamps**: Note the times when the errors occurred to correlate with other events in the logs.
- **Configuration Files**: Gather backups of configuration files for both the Authentication Agent and Azure AD Connect.
- **User Information**: Document affected users (usernames, last login times, etc.) to allow for thorough testing upon resolution.

By following this guide, you can methodically troubleshoot and resolve the AADSTS80010 error related to On-Premise Password Validation.

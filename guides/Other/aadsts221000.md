# AADSTS221000: DeviceOnlyTokensNotSupportedByResource - The resource isn't configured to accept device-only tokens.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS221000: DeviceOnlyTokensNotSupportedByResource

**Error Description**:
The error AADSTS221000 indicates that a client (device) is attempting to obtain a token from Azure Active Directory (AAD), but the resource specified in the request is not configured to accept device-only tokens. Device-only tokens are typically used in scenarios where a device is registered and authenticated, but the resource is not set up to accept these tokens.

### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps

Before diving into detailed resolutions, perform the following checks:

- **Check the Exact Error Message**: Review the complete error message to ensure it is AADSTS221000 and gather any additional context surrounding it, including the request URL and any relevant headers.
  
- **Identify the Application/Resource**: Determine which application or resource is being accessed when the error occurs.

- **Check User or Device Context**: Identify whether the request is being made by a user, a device, or a service principal. 

- **Review Application Registration**: Verify the application registration settings in Azure AD for the application throwing the error.

### 2. Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Resource Misconfiguration**: The resource (API or application) does not accept device-only tokens.
  
2. **Unsupported Authentication Flow**: Attempting to use a device-only flow against resources that do not support it.

3. **Resource Owner Consent**: The resource may not have the necessary consent granted for device-only authentication.

4. **Token Scope Mismatch**: The token request might be incorrectly scoped for device-only scenarios.

5. **Legacy Application Interfaces**: Older applications that do not support modern authentication methods may generate this error.

### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

#### Step 1: Validate Resource Configuration

- **Access the Azure portal**:
  - Sign in to https://portal.azure.com.
- **Navigate to Azure Active Directory**:
  - Go to "Azure Active Directory" > "App registrations."
- **Select the Application**:
  - Find and select the application that is being accessed.
- **Check Token Configuration**:
  - Ensure that under "Authentication" or "Expose API", the application is correctly set up to accept and validate the type of tokens being issued.
  
#### Step 2: Update Application Settings

- **Add Required Permissions**:
  - Under "API permissions", ensure permissions that grant permission to access device-only tokens are set appropriately.
  
- **Modify Manifest**:
  - Review and potentially modify the "Manifest" to ensure it supports device-only token flows, including modifying the `groupMembershipClaims` property if necessary.

#### Step 3: Review Device Registration

- **Device Registration**:
  - Verify that the device is properly registered in Azure Active Directory.
  - Check whether the device is compliant with the policies configured in the Azure AD.

#### Step 4: Testing and Validation

- **Try Different Token Types**:
  - Use tools like Postman or the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to test various token requests.
  - Attempt to use other flows such as authorization code flow or client credentials to see if those work as intended.

#### Step 5: Check Logs and Monitor

- **Monitor Logs**:
  - Utilize Azure AD Sign-in logs and audit logs to investigate further and collect any additional error information.

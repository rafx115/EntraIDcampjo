This error occurs when the user has not granted the necessary permissions for the application to perform SSO. The user should be redirected to the consent screen to grant the necessary permissions. Refer tothis announcementfor more information."


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide for the error code AADSTS9002341, which indicates that the user has not granted the necessary permissions for Single Sign-On (SSO). 

### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS9002341

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Verify User Authentication**:
   - Confirm if the user is authenticated correctly and if they have active sessions. You can check the status by logging into the application or Azure portal.
   
2. **Check Application Registration**:
   - Ensure that the application is properly registered in Azure Active Directory (AAD) and confirm the permissions (scopes) it is requesting.

3. **Review Error Message**:
   - Ensure that the user is receiving the exact error message (AADSTS9002341) related to consent permissions. Check for any additional error codes or context that may provide more details.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error
1. **Lack of User Consent**:
   - The user has not consented to the required permissions for SSO. This is often the case for first-time users or new application deployments.

2. **Change in App Registration**:
   - If application permissions or scopes have changed since the last consent, users will need to re-consent.

3. **Tenant Configuration**:
   - The Microsoft Azure Active Directory tenant might have restrictions on user consent settings that prevent users from granting permissions.

4. **Expired or Revoked Sessions**:
   - User’s session may have expired; they may need to log in again and consent.

5. **Account Permissions**:
   - The user may lack the required permissions to perform SSO due to role assignments in Azure AD.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Prompt User for Consent**:
   - Redirect the user to the consent URL. It typically looks like this:
     ```
     https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id={client_id}&response_type=code&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&scope={scopes}&response_mode=query
     ```
   - Make sure to replace `{client_id}`, `{redirect_uri}`, and `{scopes}` with your application values.

2. **Review Application Permissions in Azure AD**:
   - Go to the Azure portal:
     - Navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations > Your Application > API permissions.
     - Ensure that all necessary permissions are granted. 

3. **Admin Consent**:
   - If only admins can consent to some permissions, an Azure AD administrator should provide consent:
     - Azure portal > Azure Active Directory > Enterprise applications > Your app > Permissions > Grant admin consent.

4. **Check Tenant Settings**:
   - In Azure AD, check the user settings regarding user consent:
     - Azure portal > Azure Active Directory > User settings > User consent settings.
   - Ensure settings allow users to consent to apps.

5. **Check User Role Assignments**:
   - Confirm that the user has valid roles or licenses assigned that allow SSO within your app’s requirements:
     - Azure portal > Azure Active Directory > Users > Select user > Assigned roles.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Caching Issues**: Be aware that browser caching or session cookies may also impact SSO performance. It's advisable to test in an incognito browser session.
- **User Training**: Sometimes users may not know how to proceed with consent screens. Provide clear guidelines on the process.

#### Documentation for Guidance
- [Microsoft Documentation on Azure AD Error Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aad-error-codes)
- [Consent Framework Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-consent)
  
Please ensure that these documentation links are tested and accessible:
- **Test**: [HTTP Status Check](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-consent) (verify that you can access this documentation).

#### Advice for Data Collection
- **Error Logs**: Collect detailed error messages from the authentication logs. Include timestamps, user details, and session identifiers.
- **Consent History**: If available, access logs regarding previous consent actions (when the user last consented) from Azure AD to see if changes were made since then.
- **Network Logs**: Check for any network-related issues or firewalls that may prevent the appropriate redirects and permissions.

This comprehensive troubleshooting guide should assist in identifying and resolving issues linked to error code AADSTS9002341 effectively.

# AADSTS220450: UnsupportedAndroidWebViewVersion - The Chrome WebView version isn't supported.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS220450 - UnsupportedAndroidWebViewVersion 

The error code AADSTS220450 typically indicates that the Android WebView version used in your application is not supported for proper authentication. This often occurs in conjunction with Azure Active Directory (AAD) when performing authentication in an Android application using WebView.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Check the Error Message**: Ensure that the error returned is indeed AADSTS220450 and note any accompanying details.
2. **Identify the Environment**: Determine if you are using an emulator or a physical device and find out the version of Android and the version of Chrome/WebView installed.
3. **WebView Version**: Go to `Settings` -> `Apps` -> `Android System WebView` to see the version installed.
4. **Chrome/Chrome WebView**: Since the Android WebView relies on Chrome, check the version of Chrome installed as well.
5. **Check for System Updates**: Ensure the device is running the latest version of the operating system and that both Chrome and WebView are updated.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error:
- Outdated Android System WebView component.
- Incompatible Chrome version with Android.
- Use of features deprecated or removed in new versions of WebView.
- Incorrectly configured WebView settings in the application.
- Conflicts between different versions of WebView due to manufacturer customizations.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Update Android WebView**:
   - Open the Google Play Store app.
   - Search for "Android System WebView".
   - If there's an update available, select "Update".
   - Ensure the device is running the latest version.

2. **Update Chrome**:
   - Open the Google Play Store app.
   - Search for "Google Chrome".
   - If there's an update available, select "Update".
   - Ensure the Chrome version is supported.

3. **Reset App Preferences**:
   - Go to `Settings` -> `Apps`.
   - Tap the three dots in the upper right corner and select "Reset app preferences". 
   - This can resolve minor conflicts or settings that might be causing issues.

4. **Clear Cache and Data**: 
   - For both Android System WebView and Google Chrome, clear the cache and app data.
   - Go to `Settings` -> `Apps` -> `Android System WebView`/`Google Chrome`.
   - Tap on "Storage" -> "Clear Cache" and "Clear Data".

5. **Check Compatibility**: 
   - Refer to Microsofts Azure documentation to understand the minimum supported WebView version for the AAD libraries youre using.
   - If a specific version is required, ensure that your device's WebView matches or exceeds this version.

6. **Use Chrome for Web Authentication**:
   - If the application allows changing the authentication method, consider switching to use Chrome Custom Tabs or detecting if Chrome is installed and utilizing that instead of WebView.

7. **Testing**:
   - After applying updates and resolutions, perform a test to trigger the authentication in the application to see if the error persists.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- Device manufacturers often customize WebViews. If the issue persists, look for specific OEM-related support forums.
- In some cases, uninstallation and reinstallation of WebView and Chrome may resolve underlying issues.
- If using some enterprise-managed devices, check with your IT department for any specific configurations that may need adjustment.

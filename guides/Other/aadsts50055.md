## Initial Diagnostic Steps

2. **Check for Error Message:** Ensure the user is indeed receiving the AADSTS50055 error.
3. **User Login Attempt:** Confirm the user attempted to log in to an Azure AD-integrated application.
4. **Assess Expiration Policies:** Review the password expiration settings set by your organization.

## Common Issues Causing This Error
- The users password has indeed expired due to organizational policies.
- The user has not logged in for an extended period, triggering password expiration.
- Password policies were changed by an admin that may have affected the user.
- User accounts that were migrated from another system with differing policies could also face expiring passwords unexpectedly.

## Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **User-initiated Password Reset:**
   - If the user sees the prompt to reset their password:
     - Direct the user to follow the password reset link.
     - The user will need to answer security questions or verify identity through an alternative method (e.g., email, phone).
     - Have the user set a new password that complies with your organization's password policy.
  
2. **Admin-initiated Password Reset:**
   - If the user cannot reset their password or needs assistance:
     - An administrator can reset the users password via the Microsoft Entra ID portal:
       1. **Login to the Azure Portal:** Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
       2. **Access Azure Active Directory:** Go to 'Azure Active Directory'.
       3. **Select Users:** Click on 'Users' in the left pane and find the user in question.
       4. **Reset Password:** Select the user, and click on 'Reset Password'.
       5. **Follow Prompts:** Complete the prompts to set a new password and communicate it to the user.

3. **Modify Password Policies (if required):**
   - Review and potentially update your organizations password expiration policy if notifications are not adequately informing users prior to expiration.
   - Navigate to Azure Active Directory > User settings > Password reset > Registration.
   - Check if self-service password reset options and notifications are enabled.

4. **Communicate with Users:**
   - Encourage users to set a reminder a few days before their passwords expire.
   - Educate users on password policies (length, complexity, etc.) to reduce future issues.

## Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure the organizations password reset policies and notifications are configured properly to help users avoid expiration.
- Consider enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) alongside proper password policies to enhance security while also offering multiple ways for users to verify their identity if they forget their passwords.

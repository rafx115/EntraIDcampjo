### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Educate the User on Strong Password Practices**:
    - Ensure that users understand what constitutes a strong password.
    - A strong password typically includes:
        - At least 12 characters in length
        - A mix of upper and lower case letters
        - At least one number
        - Special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $)

2. **Password Reset**:
    - Instruct the user to create a new password that adheres to the strong password guidelines.
    - Verify they are not using any previously used passwords.

3. **Adjust Password Policies**:
    - Review your organization's password policies if many users are encountering this error. 
    - Navigate to the Azure portal:
        - Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Authentication Methods**. 
        - Adjust the necessary settings for password complexity.

4. **Audit Existing Passwords**:
    - Use tools or scripts to check the complexity of existing passwords and see if more users are facing similar challenges.

5. **Testing**:
    - After changing the password, ask the user to try logging in again with the new password to confirm the resolution.

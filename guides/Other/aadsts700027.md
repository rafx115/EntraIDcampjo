# AADSTS700027: Client assertion failed signature validation. Developer error - the app is attempting to sign in without the necessary or correct authentication parameters.


## Troubleshooting Steps
## Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS700027

### Overview
Error code AADSTS700027 indicates a problem with the signature validation of a client assertion. This usually occurs when an application attempts to sign in without the necessary authentication parameters or with incorrect parameters. 

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Check the Error Message**: Gather the full error message to better understand the context of the failure.
2. **Review Logs**: Look at the application logs and Azure AD sign-in logs to identify the precise point of failure.
3. **Confirmation of Application Registration**: Ensure that the application is registered in Azure Active Directory (AAD) and that the required permissions are granted.

---

### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **Invalid Client Secret or Certificate**: The client secret or assertion certificate might be incorrect or expired.
2. **Signature Algorithm Mismatch**: The algorithm used to sign the token could be incompatible with what Azure AD expects.
3. **Configuration Issues**: Misconfigured application settings in the Azure portal.
4. **Token Expiration**: The token could be expired or improperly formatted.
5. **API Permission Issues**: The required API permissions might not be granted, or consent might not have been provided.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Check the Client Assertion**:
   - Ensure that the assertion (JWT token) is correctly formed.
   - Validate the token's claims, particularly the `aud`, `iss`, `exp`, and `nbf` parameters.

2. **Validate Client Credentials**:
   - Go to the Azure portal, locate your application, and check the **Certificates & Secrets** section.
   - Make sure your client secret is correct and is not expired.
   - If using certificates, verify that the certificate used for signing is current and properly referenced in the application.

3. **Inspect Application Configuration**:
   - Confirm that the Redirect URI(s) in the application registration match exactly with what is configured in the code.
   - Ensure that the authentication type (for example, OAuth2 or OpenID Connect) is consistent with what your server expects.

4. **Review Token Issuer and Audience**:
   - The `iss` (issuer) claim should match the expected Azure AD issuer.
   - The `aud` (audience) should match the application ID URI registered in Azure AD.

5. **Check Signature Algorithm**:
   - Confirm that the signing key is of the expected algorithm (e.g., HMAC-SHA or RSA).
   - Verify that any used signing algorithms support the expected cryptographic standards.

6. **Test for Token Expiration**:
   - Ensure that if you're getting a token from another service, it's not expired. 

7. **Review Required Permissions**:
   - In the Azure portal, ensure that your app has the necessary permissions for the resources it’s trying to access.

8. **Test the Application Again**:
   - After making changes, run the application to see if the issue persists.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Service Principal Issues**: If your application uses a service principal, ensure it is correctly configured in Azure AD.
- **Development vs Production**: If you’re testing in a development environment, ensure that the configuration is the same as in production.
- **Rate Limiting or Throttling**: Be aware that repeated failure attempts may result in temporary account lockout or throttling.

### Advice for Data Collection
- Gather logs from your application for both errors and successful requests around the time you encountered the issue.
- Collect request and response data that include:
  - The JWT tokens being generated and their claims.
  - HTTP request headers, particularly those related to authentication.
  - The Azure AD sign-ins logs for the pertinent error event.

This data will help in diagnosing the root cause effectively and provide insights into the nature of the assertion failure.

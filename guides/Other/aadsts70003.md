# AADSTS70003: UnsupportedGrantType - The app returned an unsupported grant type.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The error code AADSTS70003 indicating "UnsupportedGrantType" suggests that the application is sending a grant type that Azure Active Directory (AAD) does not support for the authentication request. Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide for this error.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS70003: UnsupportedGrantType

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Check the Request Type**:
   - Ensure you understand the type of request being sent (e.g., authorization code, client credentials, implicit, etc.).
   - Review the parameters being sent in the request to verify the `grant_type`.

2. **Examine the Application Configuration**:
   - Verify that the application is registered correctly in the Azure Portal.
   - Check the permissions and ensure that credentials such as client ID, client secret, and redirect URIs match the configuration in the Azure AD application.

3. **Review Logs**:
   - If available, check the application logs and any error responses from the Azure Active Directory. This might give you additional context related to the request that was made.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **Incorrect Grant Type**:
   - Using a grant type that is not supported by Azure AD (e.g., using `password` grant when not configured).

2. **Typographical Errors**:
   - Misspellings in the specified `grant_type` parameter.

3. **Missing Grant Type**:
   - Omitting the `grant_type` parameter entirely in the request.

4. **Outdated Libraries/SDK**:
   - Using outdated libraries or SDKs that do not support the current authentication flows.

5. **Mismatched OAuth Flows**:
   - The application may be configured to use one OAuth flow but making a request with another flow.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Confirm Supported Grant Types**:
   - Refer to the [Microsoft Identity Platform documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) for the list of supported grant types.

2. **Inspect the Request**:
   - Look for the `grant_type` parameter in the request body and confirm its value matches one of the supported types. For instance, if you are using authorization code flow, ensure `grant_type=authorization_code`.

3. **Correct Configuration**:
   - If the grant type isnâ€™t supported, modify your application to use a valid grant type according to the OAuth 2.0 flow you want to implement (e.g., client credentials should only be used for application permissions).

4. **Update Application Libraries**:
   - Ensure that you are using the latest version of libraries for making OAuth requests. Check the relevant SDKs and libraries for any updates related to Azure AD.

5. **Test with Different Clients**:
   - Use tools like Postman to manually send requests with different `grant_type` parameters to see which ones succeed.

6. **Inspect Redirect URLs**:
   - For flows that involve redirection, verify that the redirect URI is correctly set up in the Azure portal and in the application.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Grant Types need to be correctly aligned with the flows designed in the application logic. Mixing flows may lead to unsupported types.
- Be cautious with client secrets and configurations when deploying applications in production.

#### Advice for Data Collection
- **Capture the Exact Request and Response**: Use tools like Fiddler or the developer console in your browser to capture the network requests and responses. This can include headers, body, and status codes.
- **Document Error Messages**: Keep logs of any error messages generated during the authentication attempted.
- **Environment Details**: Note the environment (staging, production) and any changes made prior to encountering the error.
- **User Context**: Collect information about the user context under which the error occurs, including roles and permissions.

By following the steps outlined in this guide, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the AADSTS70003 error effectively. If issues persist, consider reaching out to Microsoft support for further assistance.

## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS7000222

**Error Description:**  
`InvalidClientSecretExpiredKeysProvided` - The provided client secret keys are expired. Create new keys for your app, or consider using certificate credentials for added security: [https://aka.ms/certCreds](https://aka.ms/certCreds).

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Confirm the Error Code**: Ensure that the received error code is indeed `AADSTS7000222` and review the full error message for context.
   
2. **Review Application Logs**: Check the application logs or monitor logs within Azure Active Directory (AAD) to see if this issue is consistent across multiple authentication attempts or isolated to specific users/applications.

3. **Inspect Configuration**: Verify the applicationâ€™s settings in Azure Portal, particularly focusing on the credentials section for the client secrets.

### Common Issues Causing AADSTS7000222:
1. **Expired Client Secrets**: Client secrets have a defined validity period, and if they are not renewed, they expire and lead to this error.
  
2. **Incorrect Secret Usage**: The application might be using an invalid or incorrect client secret that does not match what is configured in Azure AD.

3. **App Registration Issues**: The app might be improperly registered in Azure AD, leading to conflict or invalid authentication attempts.

4. **Misconfiguration in Code**: Issues in the code related to where or how the client secret is being set can provoke this error.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

#### Step 1: Check Existing Client Secrets
1. Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Navigate to `Azure Active Directory` > `App registrations`.
3. Locate and select your application from the list.
4. Go to the `Certificates & secrets` section.
5. Review the list of client secrets. Check their status (Active/Expired).

#### Step 2: Create a New Client Secret
1. While still in the `Certificates & secrets` section, click on `New client secret`.
2. Enter a description and select the expiration period (1 year, 2 years, or Custom).
3. Click `Add`. Note down the value of the new client secret. **This is the only time you will see this value.**

#### Step 3: Update Your Application
1. Update your application code or configuration to use the newly created client secret. This may be in environment variables, configuration files, or direct code updates.
2. Ensure that all instances of the application are updated if running in multiple environments (dev, test, prod).

#### Step 4: Test the Application
1. Attempt to authenticate using the application with the new client secret.
2. Monitor for successful authentication or any new errors.

### Optional Step: Consider Using Certificate Credentials
- If security is critical for your application, consider setting up certificate-based credentials instead of client secrets:
   - Follow the guide available at [Using certificate credentials](https://aka.ms/certCreds) on the Azure documentation site.

### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- **Regularly Rotate Secrets**: Implement a strategy for regularly rotating client secrets to minimize security risks.
- **Application Lifecycle Management**: Consider the app's lifecycle, including when the app is deployed, tested, etc., to avoid unexpected downtimes due to expired secrets.

### Documentation Links:
- [Microsoft Azure App Registration Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)
- [Manage Client Secrets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#add-a-client-secret)

### Test Documentation Accessibility:
- Ensure you can access the documentation links provided above. If any links are not working, try accessing [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com) and search for the topic.

### Advice for Data Collection:
- **Collect Error Logs**: Gather logs of authentication attempts to facilitate a better understanding of failures.
- **Client ID and App Name**: Keep track of which application is encountering the error and its unique identifier to assist support teams if needed.
- **Environment Context**: Note the specific environment (dev/test/prod) where the issue is observed, as well as any related deployment events that may coincide with the error's appearance.

By following this guide, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the `AADSTS7000222` error effectively. If issues persist, consider reaching out to Microsoft Support for assistance.

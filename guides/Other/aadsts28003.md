## Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS28003

### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Confirm Error Context**:
   - Ensure you are encountering the AADSTS28003 error during the access token request phase using the authorization code flow.

2. **Review Request Details**:
   - Check the request being sent to the token endpoint. Specifically, focus on the parameters included in the body of the request.

3. **Check Authentication Configuration**:
   - Review the application registration in Azure Active Directory (AAD) to ensure proper configuration, especially regarding scopes and permissions.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error:
1. **Missing Scope Parameter**:
   - The `scope` parameter is missing or not supplied in the token request.

2. **Incorrectly Formatted Scope Parameter**:
   - The scope value provided may not be formatted according to specification (e.g., not properly concatenated).

3. **Scope Not Configured**:
   - The requested scope is not registered or valid in the AAD application.

4. **Authorization Code Issue**:
   - If the authorization code is invalid or expired, it might lead to issues in token requests.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Review the Access Token Request**:
   - Ensure the request to the token endpoint includes a valid `scope` parameter.
   - Example token request:
     ```plaintext
     POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

     client_id={client_id}
     scope={scope}
     code={authorization_code}
     redirect_uri={redirect_uri}
     client_secret={client_secret}
     grant_type=authorization_code
     ```

2. **Specify a Valid Scope**:
   - Determine the appropriate scopes for your application from the Azure portal.
   - Common scopes for Microsoft APIs include `openid`, `profile`, `offline_access`, and any specific API scopes defined.

3. **Modify Request as Needed**:
   - Add or modify the `scope` in your request:
     - Use comma-separated scopes for multiple permissions (e.g., `openid profile offline_access`).

4. **Test with Graph Explorer**:
   - Use Microsoft Graph Explorer to test and verify valid scopes and understand how they should be formatted.

5. **Check App Registration Settings**:
   - In the Azure Portal, navigate to your app registration:
     - Go to "API permissions" and ensure appropriate API permissions are granted and consented.

6. **Update Application Code**:
   - If dynamically building the request, ensure that the application code is correctly implementing and passing scopes.

### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- **Authorization Code Expiry**: Ensure that the authorization code is not expired. Codes are typically short-lived.
- **Confidential vs. Public Clients**: Be aware of the differences in scope requirements for different client types (confidential vs. public).
- **Revocation of Permissions**: If user permissions have changed, scopes may need to be re-consented.

### Documentation Guidance:
- For more details on token requests and scopes, refer to:
  - [OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow)
  - [Scopes and Permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/scopes)
  - [API Permissions in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/permissions-reference)

### Test Documentation Reachability:
- Verify that you can access the documentation using a standard web browser to ensure it is reachable.
- Example URLs:
  - [OAuth Authorization Code Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow)
  - [Scopes and API Permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/scopes)

### Advice for Data Collection:
- When reporting issues to support or collecting for your own analysis, gather:
  - The full URL of the token request.
  - Request and response headers.
  - Request body parameters (including the `scope` parameter).
  - Any logs that provide context (e.g., error messages, timestamps).
  - Details of the application registration in Azure AD, including the defined scopes and permissions.

# AADSTS90024: RequestBudgetExceededError - A transient error has occurred. Try again.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS90024 - RequestBudgetExceededError

The AADSTS90024 error indicates that a transient issue has occurred, typically due to rate limiting or resource allocation problems in Azure Active Directory (AAD). Here’s a comprehensive guide to diagnose and resolve this issue.

---

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Verify Error Details**: Confirm the exact error message, especially including the error code (`AADSTS90024`).
2. **Check Service Status**: Visit the [Azure Service Status page](https://status.azure.com/en-us/status) to identify any ongoing incidents or outages.
3. **Review Recent Changes**: Evaluate any recent changes to your AAD configuration, applications, or any deployed services that could have impacted performance.

---

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error
- **Exceeding Throttle Limits**: Repeated requests to AAD can lead to hitting the rate limits set for your tenant.
- **High Load on Services**: Unusually high traffic, such as a large number of simultaneous logins or requests from users or applications.
- **Transient Network Issues**: Temporary issues with the network infrastructure affecting connectivity to AAD.
- **Misconfigurations**: Issues related to application registration settings or permission scopes.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Retry Logic Implementation**: As this is a transient error, implement retry logic with exponential backoff in your application to handle it automatically.
2. **Monitor Usage Patterns**: Analyze logs to understand patterns of usage and identify peaks. Azure Monitor or Application Insights can be used to collect this data.
3. **Application Configuration Review**:
   - Check application registrations in Azure AD.
   - Inspect API permissions and ensure they are correctly set.
   - Review the maximum number of concurrent connections if applicable.
4. **Adjust Configuration**:
   - If you consistently hit thresholds, consider requesting an increase in the service limits through Azure Support.
   - If the application is generating too many requests, review the application logic for optimization.
5. **Escalate to Support**: If the error persists after addressing all known issues and optimizing your configuration, contact Azure Support for assistance.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Transient errors like AADSTS90024 are often resolved on their own. Allowing for a brief period between retries is a standard best practice.
- Regularly review the application’s performance and user access patterns to anticipate load.
- Implement logging around authentication requests to better understand when and why the error occurs.

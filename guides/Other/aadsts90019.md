# AADSTS90019: MissingTenantRealm - Microsoft Entra ID was unable to determine the tenant identifier from the request.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS90019: MissingTenantRealm

The error code AADSTS90019, with the description "Microsoft Entra ID was unable to determine the tenant identifier from the request," can occur when applications attempt to authenticate users but do not properly specify the tenant context required by Azure Active Directory.

#### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps
Before diving into detailed troubleshooting, start with the following initial diagnostics:
- **Identify the Context**: Determine where the error occurred (e.g., application type, authentication method).
- **Check Application Logs**: Review the logs of the application handling authentication to gather any specific error messages or stack traces.
- **Review User Input**: Ensure the username or email address entered by the user is in the correct format and associated with the expected tenant.
- **Check the URL**: Verify that the URLs being used for authentication (authorization and token endpoints) are correctly configured.

#### 2. Common Issues that Cause This Error
- **Incorrect Tenant Specification**: The authentication request does not specify a valid tenant ID or domain.
- **Multi-Tenant Configuration Errors**: The application is registered as multi-tenant and does not properly handle tenant resolution.
- **Malformed URLs**: The authentication URL might be incorrectly formatted.
- **Invalid User Input**: The username or email entered does not match any user within the intended tenant.

#### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
Here are strategies to resolve the issue based on what's causing it:

##### **A. Validate the Authentication Request**
1. **Check the Tenant Parameter**: Ensure that the request URL includes the tenant ID or name (`https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/`).
2. **Use `common` or `organizations` Parameter:**
   - For multi-tenant apps, use `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/` or `https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations/` to avoid tenant-specific requests if the tenant is not known.

##### **B. Confirm Application Registration Settings**
1. **Navigate to Azure Portal**: Go to the Azure Portal and locate your application under "Azure Active Directory" > "App registrations".
2. **Check Authentication Settings**:
   - Make sure the application is configured to accept the scopes and redirects required.
   - Confirm that you have set the application to be either single-tenant or multi-tenant according to your requirements.

##### **C. User Email Verification**
1. **Email Format**: Ensure the user email being processed is in a valid format (`user@domain.com`).
2. **Domain Verification**: Cross-check if the domain used in the email matches the tenants you intend to authenticate against.

##### **D. Update and Test Authentication Logic**
1. **Update Code**: If applicable, update your authentication logic to include tenant IDs consistently.
2. **Test Auth Flow**: After making changes, perform end-to-end tests of the authentication flow to monitor for the error.

#### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Federal and Commercial**: Be mindful of whether you are doing this in a government cloud setup versus commercial Azure as they have different endpoints.
- **Error Messages**: Sometimes, the error message details will indicate what is missing. Pay close attention to any other error details that accompany the AADSTS90019.

#### 5. Documentation for Guidance
- **Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) Documentation**: 
  - [Microsoft Identity platform documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/)
- **Application Registration in Azure AD**:
  - [Register an application with Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)
- **Error Code AADSTS90019 Explanation**:
  - [AADSTS90019 Error Details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aadsts-error-codes)

#### 6. Test Documentation Accessibility
Test that the links provided in the documentation sections are reachable in a browser. For example, you can visit one of the links (like https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) and ensure it loads successfully.

#### 7. Advice for Data Collection
- **Collect Logs**: Gather logs of failed authentication attempts from your application and Azure AD sign-in logs to find correlation details and timestamps.
- **User Context**: Collect information about the users experiencing the issue (e.g., their domain, any recent changes they made, etc.).
- **Error Message Samples**: Keep records of the full error messages returned during authentication attempts to facilitate better diagnosis.

By following this guide carefully, the cause of the AADSTS90019 error can often be identified and effectively resolved. If the problem persists after following these steps, consider reaching out to Microsoft support or the community forums with detailed information for assistance.

# Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50002: NotAllowedTenant

The error code `AADSTS50002` indicates that a sign-in attempt failed due to restricted proxy access on the tenant. This typically occurs in a multi-tenant scenario where tenants may have policies in place to restrict access for various security and operational reasons. Below is a comprehensive troubleshooting guide to diagnose and resolve this error.

## Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Verify Tenant Information**: 
   - Ensure that the sign-in request is targeting the correct tenant. Confirm that the user is part of that tenant.
   
2. **Check User Credentials**:
   - Validate that the user is using the correct username and password.
   - Confirm that the account is active and not locked or expired.

3. **Consult with the Admin**:
   - If youÂ’re not the tenant administrator, contact the administrator to confirm any policies regarding restricted access.

4. **Diagnose Through Logs**:
   - Review sign-in logs and any related authentication logs for further details on the failure. This can provide insights into why access was restricted.

## Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Restricted Proxy Access Policies**:
   - Tenant security settings may prohibit certain users or applications from accessing resources.

2. **Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Enforcement of conditional access policies that may prevent access based on location, device compliance, or user group.

3. **User Not Assigned to Application**:
   - The user attempting to sign in may not have been assigned the necessary roles or permissions to access the application.

4. **Tenant Configuration Changes**:
   - Recent changes in tenant configuration by administrators may lead to unexpected access restrictions.

## Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

### 1. Evaluate Restricted Authentication Policies

- **Login to Azure Portal**:
  - Go to Azure Active Directory > Security > Conditional Access.
- **Review Policies**:
  - Identify any policies that might restrict access based on the user's circumstances (location, device, etc.).
- **Modify if Necessary**:
  - Adjust or remove restrictive policies if you have the necessary permissions.

### 2. Adjust Tenant Settings

- **Access Tenant Settings**:
  - Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > Properties > User settings.
- **Update Access Settings**:
  - If you're the admin, review the user settings and modify the 'users can invite guest users' or similar settings as required.

### 3. Assign Necessary Permissions

- **Application Registrations**:
  - Ensure the user is assigned to the application needing access. Go to Azure Active Directory > App registrations > [Your Application].
- **Check API Permissions**:
  - Make sure required permissions are granted for the application and consent given by an admin.

### 4. Clear Cache and Retry

- Encourage users to clear their browser cache and cookies or attempt to access the application through an incognito/private window to eliminate local caching issues.

## Additional Notes or Considerations

- If organizational policies do not allow you to make changes, reach out to the appropriate administrative personnel for support.
- Document all steps taken in case escalation is required.

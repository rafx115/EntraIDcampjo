# AADSTS80014: OnPremisePasswordValidationAuthenticationAgentTimeout - Validation request responded after maximum elapsed time exceeded. Open a support ticket with the error code, correlation ID, and timestamp to get more details on this error.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS80014 Error Code

#### Overview
The error code AADSTS80014 indicates a timeout issue while validating user credentials against an on-premises Active Directory environment. This typically occurs in setups where Azure Active Directory (AAD) is integrated with an on-premises authentication mechanism (like ADFS) and is unable to reach or receive a timely response from the on-premises validation service. 

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Reproduce the Error**: Attempt to log in to the application experiencing the error. Gather details such as the exact time when the error occurs and the conditions under which it happens.
   
2. **Check Azure AD Service Status**: Verify if there are any service outages or issues affecting Azure Active Directory by checking the Microsoft Azure status page: 
   [Azure Status](https://status.azure.com)

3. **Review Logs**: Look into Azure AD sign-in logs for more details about the failed authentication attempt associated with the correlation ID.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error
- Network issues preventing the connection between Azure AD and the on-premises authentication server.
- Firewall rules blocking the necessary ports or protocols for communication.
- High load on the on-premises authentication server resulting in slow response times.
- Incorrect configuration of the Password Validation Authentication Agent or its timeout settings.
- Service unavailability due to maintenance or unexpected failures on the on-premises validation service.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Network Connectivity Check**:
   - Verify that the on-premises servers running the Password Validation Agent are reachable from Azure AD. This can include checking IP connectivity (ping) and DNS resolution.
   - Ensure that firewalls and network security groups allow traffic on the necessary ports (e.g., port 443 for HTTPS).

2. **Review the Password Validation Agent Settings**:
   - Log into the machine running the Password Validation Agent and confirm it is running properly.
   - Check the agent configuration settings, ensuring that they align with best practices and that the service is not facing resource limitations.

3. **Increase Timeout Settings**:
   - If necessary, adjust the timeout settings for the Password Validation Authentication Agent. This can be done by following the related configuration documentation:
   - Documentation: [Configure Password Validation Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-password-hash-sync)

4. **Monitor Load and Performance**:
   - Review the performance metrics on the server running the authentication agent. Look for CPU, memory, and network performance bottlenecks that could lead to delays.
   - Consider scaling resources if the server is under heavy load.

5. **Test Connectivity Using PowerShell Script**:
   - Use a PowerShell script to test the connectivity and validate that the authentication agent can communicate correctly with Azure AD. This can provide insight into where connectivity may be failing.

6. **Logs Review for Errors**:
   - Check the logs for the Password Validation Agent located in the "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure AD Password Protection" directory for any specific error messages or patterns.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that the system and any involved components are up to date with the latest patches and updates to avoid issues related to software bugs.
- If issues persist beyond your control, raising a support ticket with Microsoft may be necessary. Include the error code, correlation ID, and timestamp.

#### Advice for Data Collection
When preparing for support or further diagnosis:
- Keep a record of timestamps of failed attempts.
- Collect relevant logs from both Azure AD and the on-premises authentication agent.
- Document any changes made to the configuration or infrastructure leading up to the start of the issue.
- If you capture any network logs or packet traces, be sure to provide these to support for further analysis.

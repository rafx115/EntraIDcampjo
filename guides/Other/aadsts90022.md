AADSTS90022 indicates that there is an issue with the format of the principal name being passed in the authentication request.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Review the Error Message**: Start by carefully reading the full error message returned with the AADSTS90022 error code. Look for any specific details that might shed light on the cause.

2. **Check Input Format**: Ensure that the principal name being used in the authentication process is formatted correctly. It should follow the format of either `user@domain` or `username`.

3. **Test Authentication Request**: If possible, isolate the authentication request causing the problem and attempt to replicate the error in a controlled environment.

4. **Verify User Input**: If the principal name is being input by a user, verify that they are entering it correctly without any extra spaces or invalid characters.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **Improper Principal Name Format**: The most common issue is that the principal name does not follow the required format (missing domain, incorrect symbols, etc.).

2. **Use of Special Characters**: Avoid special characters or whitespace within the principal name that may not be supported.

3. **Misconfigured Application**: If the application that is generating authentication requests has misconfigurations, it may lead to incorrectly formatted principal names being sent.

4. **User Account Issues**: The principal being referenced doesn’t exist in the directory, or it might have recently been deleted or renamed.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify Principal Name Format**:
   - Check to ensure that the principal name adheres to the format:
     - **Correct**: `user@domain.com` or `username`
     - **Incorrect**: `user domain` or `user@` (lack of domain)

2. **Modify Application Configurations**:
   - If your application generates the principal name, review its settings and code to ensure the proper format is applied when constructing the principal name.

3. **Validate User Exists**:
   - Ensure that the user trying to authenticate exists in the Azure AD directory. You can do this through the Azure Portal:
     - Navigate to Azure Active Directory → Users.
     - Search for the user in question and validate their details.

4. **Reconstruct the Request**:
   - If directly working with API calls or manually constructing requests, check that the request matches expected formats, as per AAD documentation.

5. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Use tools like Postman or Fiddler to check the actual requests being sent to Azure AD.
   - Identify where the principal name is being set and adjust it as needed.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Make sure that any changes made are tested in a development or testing environment before rolling them out to production.
- Check if similar issues are affecting other users, which may indicate a broader configuration problem.
- Ensure that the Azure AD service has no known outages or service interruptions via the Azure status page.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify the Context:**
   - Determine when the error occurs. Does it happen during a specific action or under certain conditions?
   - Document the user or service accounts involved. Note if multiple users are affected.

2. **Check the Frontend Integration:**
   - Assess if the application is a web application, mobile app, or any other service making requests to Azure AD.
   - Verify that the application handles session IDs correctly.

3. **Gather Logs:**
   - Enable and collect logs from the relevant application and Azure AD logs to gather detailed information.
   - Check for any additional error messages or warnings that may provide more context.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Expired or Invalid Session:**
   - The user session may have expired or was invalidated, leading to parsing issues with the session ID.

2. **Misconfiguration in Application:**
   - Incorrect Redirect URI or issues with the Authentication Configuration in Azure AD.

3. **Session ID Manipulation:**
   - The session ID may be altered during transmission, leading to a format that Azure AD cannot parse.

4. **Client-side or Server-side Caching:**
   - Cached tokens or session data may be outdated or corrupt.

5. **Browser Issues:**
   - Issue with browser settings or extensions affecting session handling, such as cookie management.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Review Application Code:**
   - Ensure that the method used to handle session IDs conforms to Azure AD standards.
   - Check for serialization or encoding issues with session ID.

2. **Clear Sessions and Cache:**
   - Instruct users to clear their browser cache and cookies. Alternatively, re-run the applicationâ€™s session management to reset the session IDs.

3. **Session Expiry Settings:**
   - Check Azure AD configurations regarding session expiration and ensure they are set correctly to avoid premature session invalidation.

4. **Check Application Registration:**
   - Log in to the Azure AD portal and validate the application registration settings:
     - Correct Redirect URIs
     - Appropriate Application Permissions
     - Valid Client Id and Secret

5. **Test Different Browsers/Devices:**
   - Try accessing the application from different browsers or devices to rule out local client issues.

6. **Implement Error Handling Logic:**
   - Enhance the application to handle session errors gracefully and provide users with clear instructions or messages.

7. **Contact Microsoft Support:**
   - If the issue persists after following the above steps, consider reaching out to Microsoft support for deeper investigation.

## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS7000112 - UnauthorizedClientApplicationDisabled

#### Error Description:
The error code AADSTS7000112 indicates that the application you are trying to use has been disabled in the Azure Active Directory (AAD). Users will encounter this error when attempting to sign in or access resources using an application that is either disabled or not properly configured in AAD.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps:

1. **Verify the Error Message**: Ensure that the error you are encountering is indeed AADSTS7000112. Check logs and reports for exact error codes and descriptions.
   
2. **Identify the Application**: Determine which application is causing the issue. This could be a third-party application, custom application, or Microsoft service.

3. **Review User Context**: Confirm if all users or specific users are facing the same issue. This can help isolate whether it's a user-specific or application-wide problem.

4. **Check Application ID**: Make sure you have the correct application ID (client ID) being used in the application or service.

### Common Issues that Cause This Error:

- The application has been explicitly disabled in the Azure portal.
- The application hasn’t been correctly registered in Azure Active Directory.
- Permission issues related to application roles or users.
- Changes in the Azure subscription or access policies affecting the application.
- Misconfigured redirect URIs or authentication settings.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **Check Application Registration**:
   - Go to the Azure portal: [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations**.
   - Locate the affected application. Check if the status shows as "Enabled."

2. **Enable the Application**:
   - If the application is disabled, click on it, and in the overview blade, change its status to "Enabled."
   - Verify if the application permissions and API access are set correctly.

3. **Review User Permissions**:
   - In **Azure Active Directory**, go to **Enterprise applications**.
   - Find the application and check **Users and groups**. Ensure users who need access are assigned correctly and that they meet any required role or permission specifications.

4. **Check for Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Under **Security**, check any **Conditional Access** policies that may restrict access to certain applications based on conditions like location, user state, or device state.

5. **Review Service Principal**:
   - Service Principal may need to be validated to make sure it’s set up correctly for authentication. Go to **App registrations** > **[Your Application]** > **Certificates & secrets** to check this.

6. **Re-Registration (if necessary)**:
   - If substantial issues arise regarding configuration, consider un-registering the application and then re-registering it according to the deployment guidelines.

### Additional Notes or Considerations:

- Ensure you understand the implications of enabling or disabling application access, especially in environments with multiple stakeholders.
- If the issue persists even after trying the above steps, check other applications that integrate using the same permissions or scopes, as they may also be impacted.

# AADSTS75008: RequestDeniedError - The request from the app was denied since the SAML request had an unexpected destination.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Troubleshooting the AADSTS75008 error code, particularly when associated with the message **"RequestDeniedError - The request from the app was denied since the SAML request had an unexpected destination"**, involves systematic diagnostic steps. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide to help you resolve this issue:

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify the Context**: 
   - Determine which application is generating the error.
   - Confirm whether the issue is occurring during user sign-in or a specific service access.

2. **Reproduce the Error**:
   - Attempt to reproduce the error to confirm its persistence. Note the specific steps leading to the error.
  
3. **Check Log Files**: 
   - Review the logs of your application and Azure AD for detailed error messages that can provide more context on the failure.

### Common Issues that Cause this Error

1. **Incorrect SAML Configuration**:
   - The SAML request may be directed to the wrong endpoint or contain an invalid service provider (SP) URL.

2. **Mismatch in Relay State**:
   - Misconfigured RelayState or additional parameters that might confuse the endpoint routing.

3. **Service Provider (SP) URL Variations**:
   - Subdomains, paths, or HTTP vs. HTTPS mismatches can lead to "unexpected destination" errors.

4. **Application Registration Issues**:
   - If the application is not properly registered in Azure AD or if the identifiers are not matching.

5. **Certificate Issues**:
   - If there's a mismatch in the signing certificates used by the application and Azure AD.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify SAML Configuration**:
   - Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **Enterprise applications** > <Your Application> > **Single sign-on**.
   - Review the **Basic SAML Configuration** section to ensure that:
     - The **Identifier (Entity ID)** is set correctly.
     - The **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** must match the URL your application expects.
     - Any alternate logs that reference other URL routes should be checked.
  
2. **Check Authentication Settings in App**:
   - Ensure that your application's SAML settings point to the correct Azure AD instance. 
   - If applicable, verify that the assertion consumer URL reflects the URL that Azure AD is expecting.

3. **Inspect Relay State**:
   - Confirm that any RelayState parameters used in the SAML request are valid and intended for your application.

4. **Application Registration Review**:
   - Ensure your application is registered properly under **Azure AD** > **App registrations**, and check the configuration.
   - Confirm any required permissions are granted and consented to.

5. **Azure AD Sign-on Logs**:
   - Check the sign-in logs in Azure AD. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Sign-ins** to find specific logs related to the failed sign-ins. Look for related error codes and messages for additional context.

6. **Test with Other Browsers/Incognito**:
   - Sometimes cached responses can cause issues. Test with an incognito or private browser session to rule out caching problems.

7. **Consult Documentation**:
   - Refer to the Microsoft Azure Documentation for further guidance:
     - [How to configure Single Sign-On with SAML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-saml-protocol)
     - [Troubleshooting SAML-based SSO](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/troubleshoot-saml-sso)

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Ensure that you have the right permissions to view and modify the SAML settings in Azure AD.
- Be mindful of hours of operation for changes and rebooting services if necessary to propagate configuration updates.
- DNS-related issues can sometimes prevent correct routing. Confirm proper domain routing in your network configuration.
- After making changes, allow some time for settings to take effect and try to reproduce the sign-in error again.

### Documentation Accessibility Test

You can visit the following links to ensure that documentation is reachable:
1. [How to configure Single Sign-On with SAML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-saml-protocol)
2. [Troubleshooting SAML-based SSO](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/troubleshoot-saml-sso)

### Advice for Data Collection

- Log all errors and warnings encountered during SAML requests to analyze patterns.
- Capture the SAML request and response using tools like Fiddler or browser development tools to identify exactly what was sent to Azure AD.
- Consider implementing detailed logging within your application to capture the specifics of when errors occur.

By following these steps diligently, you should be able to identify and resolve the issues leading to the AADSTS75008 error effectively.

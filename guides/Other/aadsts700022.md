# AADSTS700022: InvalidMultipleResourcesScope - The provided value for the input parameter scope isn't valid because it contains more than one resource.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS700022: InvalidMultipleResourcesScope

#### Description:
The error code AADSTS700022 describes an issue where the input parameter `scope` contains more than one resource, which is not valid. This typically occurs within an Azure Active Directory (AAD) context when requesting access tokens.

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Understand the Context**: Identify where the error is occurringâ€”this could be during an OAuth2.0 authorization flow, API request, or while using SDKs/libraries for authentication.
  
2. **Check Application Logs**: Examine the logs for the application where the error occurred. Look for any details around the scope requested.

3. **Review the Request**: Capture the full HTTP request that caused the error, especially the section that includes the `scope` parameter.

4. **Identify Resources**: Make note of what resources the application is attempting to access and whether they're from multiple Azure services.

### Common Issues that Cause This Error
1. **Multiple Resource Requests**: The `scope` parameter is incorrectly formatted to include scopes for more than one resource. For instance, combining Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and Microsoft Graph APIs in one request.

2. **Improper Scope Format**: Scopes are improperly concatenated. For example, using a comma to separate them instead of using separate requests.

3. **Misconfigured Azure Application**: The application's API permissions within Azure Active Directory might not be set up properly, leading to invalid scopes.

4. **Versioning Issues**: Using an outdated SDK that may not handle scopes properly.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Review Scope Format**:
   - Ensure that the `scope` parameter is a space-separated string of valid scopes for a single resource.
   - Example of a valid scope for Microsoft Graph: `https://graph.microsoft.com/user.read`.

2. **Separate Requests**:
   - If access to multiple resources is needed, make separate token requests for each resource instead of combining them in one.

3. **Check Azure AD application configuration**:
   - Go to the **Azure Portal**.
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations** > Select your application.
   - Under **API permissions**, ensure you have set the permissions correctly for the respective resources.

4. **Utilize the Correct SDK and Library Versions**:
   - Ensure that the libraries and SDKs used for authentication are up-to-date. Check for any breaking changes in the library documentation regarding scope handling.

5. **Testing**:
   - After making changes, test the authentication flows locally if applicable or deploy changes to a staging environment to ensure that the problem is resolved before going to production.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Token Lifetime**: Be aware of how long tokens are valid and design your application to handle token refresh correctly.
- **Scope Names**: Confirm that the correct and full scope names are used, including the resource identifier when necessary (e.g., `https://resource/.default`).
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to capture and relay meaningful messages should this issue arise again.

### Documentation for Guidance
- **Microsoft Identity Platform Documentation**: [Microsoft Identity Platform Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/)
- **AAD Authentication and Authorization**: [Azure Active Directory Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)
- **OAuth2.0 Authorization flow**: [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow)

**Note**: Ensure that the documentation link is reachable and check any specific guides based on the scenario you are dealing with.

### Advice for Data Collection
- **Capture Request and Response Logs**: Log the requests made for token acquisition along with response statuses and body content.
- **Collect Application Configuration**: Document any relevant configurations including client ID, tenant ID, client secrets, and API permissions.
- **Detailed Error Information**: Gather any detailed error messages along with console or network logs if you're debugging a web application.

# AADSTS81010: DesktopSsoAuthTokenInvalid - Seamless SSO failed because the user's Kerberos ticket has expired or is invalid.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Sure! Here's a detailed troubleshooting guide for addressing error code **AADSTS81010**, which indicates that Seamless SSO has failed because the user's Kerberos ticket has expired or is invalid.

### **Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS81010**

#### **1. Initial Diagnostic Steps**
- **Identify the Environment:**
  - Confirm if the issue occurs in a specific domain or across multiple domains.
  - Determine whether the issue affects all users or a subset of users.

- **Check User Credentials:**
  - Make sure the user is properly signed in with valid credentials.
  - Verify if the user’s account is active and not locked.

- **Confirm Network Connectivity:**
  - Ensure that the device has proper network access to the Domain Controllers and Azure AD.

- **Gather Error Details:**
  - Check the exact error message in logs or diagnostic tools to ensure it's indeed related to AADSTS81010.

#### **2. Common Issues That Cause This Error**
- **Expired Kerberos Ticket:**
  - User’s Kerberos ticket might have expired due to inactivity or timeout settings.

- **Incorrect Time Settings:**
  - Time synchronization issues between the client machine and the domain controller can invalidate tickets.

- **Group Policy Changes:**
  - Recent changes in Group Policy affecting the Kerberos policy or authentication settings.

- **Network Configuration:**
  - Firewall or proxy issues that might block authentication requests.

- **Domain Trust Issues:**
  - Issues with trust relationships between domains, especially in multi-domain scenarios.

#### **3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies**

- **Step 1: Renew Kerberos Ticket**
  - Instruct the user to run the command `klist` in the Command Prompt to check the status of their Kerberos tickets.
  - If the ticket has expired, run `kinit` (if on Linux) or use `net user <username> /domain` (on Windows) to renew the ticket.

- **Step 2: Check Time Synchronization**
  - Verify that the client machine's clock is synchronized with the Domain Controller. You can check the time settings and run the command `w32tm /query /status` to check the synchronization status.

- **Step 3: Review User Account and Group Policies**
  - Inspect the user’s account to ensure it has not been disabled or locked out.
  - Review relevant Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to ensure no configuration inadvertently affects Kerberos ticketing.

- **Step 4: Investigate Network Configurations**
  - Check firewall settings and ensure that necessary ports for Kerberos authentication (UDP 88, TCP 88) and DNS are open.
  - Ensure that there are no proxy configurations blocking authentication requests.

- **Step 5: Perform Domain Trust Verification**
  - If in a multi-domain scenario, verify the existence of trust relationships. Use tools like `Active Directory Domains and Trusts` to confirm.

#### **4. Additional Notes or Considerations**
- **Log Analysis:** 
  - Review Event Viewer logs on the client and server-side for specific Kerberos-related errors.
  
- **Network Configuration Check:** 
  - Explore the possibility of a recent network changes or configuration that may have affected connectivity to AD.

- **User Profile Issues:**
  - In some cases, user profile corruption can be an issue. Testing with a new user profile may be necessary.

#### **5. Documentation for Steps**
- Refer to Microsoft’s official documentation on [Kerberos Authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/kerberos-authentication-overview).
- For Seamless Single Sign-On, refer to [Seamless SSO Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sso).
- Documentation on troubleshooting Kerberos can also be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/security/authentication-kerberos).

#### **6. Testing the Documentation Reachability**
Please ensure you can access the links provided above from your network's browsing policies. If some links are not reachable, ensure that your network is not blocking any Microsoft domain addresses.

#### **7. Advice for Data Collection**
- Collect user logs from the affected client, including:
  - Application logs related to Azure AD authentication.
  - System logs from Event Viewer, particularly focusing on security and application logs.
- Gather details about the environment:
  - Domain controllers and their health status using tools like `dcdiag`.
  - Details about the authentication flow (success and failure logs).

Following these comprehensive steps should guide you in diagnosing and resolving the `AADSTS81010` error effectively.

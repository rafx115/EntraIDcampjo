## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS65004: UserDeclinedConsent

### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps

Before diving deep into troubleshooting, perform the following initial diagnostic steps:

- **Verify the Error Context:** Identify when the error occurs. Is it during sign-in or when accessing specific features of the application?
- **Check User Role and Permissions:** Ensure that the user is assigned the necessary roles and permissions within Azure Active Directory to access the application.
- **Iframe/Popup Block:** Check whether the application is being accessed within a browser environment that might block pop-ups, as consent journeys often use pop-ups.

---

### 2. Common Issues that Cause This Error

- **User Declined Consent:** The user explicitly declined to grant the permissions when prompted during sign-in.
- **Consent Required for New Permissions:** The application may have been updated to require new permissions that the user has not yet consented to.
- **Unconfigured Application in AAD:** The application might not be properly registered within Azure AD.
- **License Issues:** The user may not have the appropriate licensing to utilize certain features of the application.

### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

#### Step 1: Retry Sign-In
1. Instruct the user to try signing in again.
2. When prompted for consent, ensure they review the permissions and accept them.

#### Step 2: User Account Review
1. Check the user account in Azure AD:
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Users**.
   - Find and select the affected user.
2. Review assigned roles and permissions or licenses.

#### Step 3: Verify Application Registration
1. In Azure AD, go to **App Registrations**.
2. Select the application in question.
3. Under **API permissions**, verify that the permissions required are correctly listed and that they include user consent.

#### Step 4: Manage User Consent and Permissions
1. If the app requires an admin consent, ensure that an administrator has granted the necessary permissions:
   - Go to **Enterprise applications** and find the application.
   - Under **Permissions**, check if any permissions require admin consent and grant it if necessary.

#### Step 5: Enable User Consent
1. Check whether users can consent to applications in your tenant settings:
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Enterprise applications** > **User settings**.
   - Ensure that the option **“Users can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf”** is enabled.

### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Incognito/Private Mode:** Instruct the user to attempt signing in using an incognito/private browsing window to rule out caching issues.
- **Network Issues:** Check for any corporate firewall settings or VPN issues that might affect application access.

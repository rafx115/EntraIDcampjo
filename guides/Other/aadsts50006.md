# AADSTS50006: InvalidSignature - Signature verification failed because of an invalid signature.


## Troubleshooting Steps
# Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50006: InvalidSignature

The error code AADSTS50006 indicates that there's an issue with the signature verification of a security token in Azure Active Directory. It points to a failed check due to an invalid signature. Here's how you can approach troubleshooting this issue.

## Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check the Error Context**: 
   - Review logs or application outputs to see the full details around when the error occurred, such as time, user involved, and operation attempted.

2. **Verify the Token**:
   - If you have access to the JWT (JSON Web Token), decode it using tools like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to inspect its header and signature.

3. **Check Application Configuration**:
   - Validate that the application is correctly registered in Azure AD.
   - Ensure correct client ID, secret, and other configurations are present within your application.

4. **Identify the Azure AD Tenant**:
   - Confirm that the Azure AD tenant being used is the correct one intended for the application.

## Common Issues that Cause AADSTS50006

1. **Mismatched Keys**: 
   - The signing keys used to validate the token do not match the keys used to sign the token.

2. **Expired or Incorrect Certificates**:
   - The signing certificates used in Azure AD may have expired or been updated.

3. **Clock Skew**:
   - Time synchronization issues between the client and Azure AD can lead to signature verification failures.

4. **Incorrect Application ID URI**:
   - An application ID URI mismatch can cause this issue when validating access tokens.

5. **Configuration Errors**:
   - Applications may be misconfigured, particularly regarding redirect URIs, permissions, or secret/password.

## Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

### Step 1: Verify Signing Keys
- Go to the Azure portal.
- Navigate to Azure Active Directory -> App registrations.
- Select your app and go to the "Certificates & secrets" section.
- Ensure the public key used to sign the tokens is present.

### Step 2: Refresh Endpoint Access
- Clear any cached keys by renewing your access tokens.
- Ensure your app retrieves the latest signing certificates from the Azure AD (typically found at `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/discovery/v2.0/keys`).

### Step 3: Check Token and Client Configuration
- Validate that the token issued is signed using the correct signing key for your application.
- Ensure the application is configured under 'Authentication' in Azure AD to support the required authentication flows and has the correct permissions.

### Step 4: Assess Time Settings
- Ensure the system clock on the server or client making the request is accurately synchronized with an NTP server.
- Check if the difference in time is more than five minutes.

### Step 5: Inspect Application Settings
- Double-check the application ID URI in Azure AD, ensuring it is correctly specified in your application configuration.
- Review any related permissions or scopes assigned to your application. 

## Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Debugging**: Utilize the Azure AD sign-in logs to track issues related to sign-in attempts, which can provide insights into where the failure is occurring.
- **Testing**: Consider creating a minimal test case to isolate the problem.

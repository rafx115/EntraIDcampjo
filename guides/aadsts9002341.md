### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check the Application Registration**:
   - Ensure the application is properly registered in Azure AD.
   - Verify that the application has been set up to require SSO.

2. **Review the User Experience**:
   - Identify if users are prompted for consent when signing into the application.
   - Note if users have previously accepted or declined the permissions.

3. **Authentication Context**:
   - Determine if the user is authenticated through Azure AD.
   - Check how the authentication flow is working (e.g., is it using OAuth2.0, OpenID Connect, etc.).

4. **User Attribute Verification**:
   - Confirm that the user account belongs to the correct directory and has adequate licenses.
   - Check if the user has permissions to access the application.

### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **User Consent Not Granted**:
   - The user has not consented to the application requiring SSO permissions.

2. **Insufficient Permissions in the App**:
   - The application may require more permissions than what has been granted.

3. **Misconfigured Application Settings**:
   - The app's permissions or settings in Azure may be improperly configured, leading to consent issues.

4. **Group Policies or Tenant Settings**:
   - Organizational policies might restrict users from granting consent.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Redirect to Consent Screen**:
   - Modify the application to redirect users to a consent screen where they can grant the necessary permissions for SSO.

2. **Update Application Permissions**:
   - Navigate to Azure Portal:
     - Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations** > Select your application.
     - Go to **API permissions** and review the permission scopes. Confirm public permissions are properly set.

3. **User Consent**:
   - If applicable, you can force user consent:
     - Admins can grant consent for the entire tenant by clicking on “Grant admin consent” for the desired API permissions.

4. **Check Tenant Settings**:
   - Review tenant-level policies that may restrict user consent:
     - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Enterprise applications** > **User settings** > Set "Users can consent to apps they are granted access to" appropriately.

5. **Test with Another Account**:
   - Try to log in with a different user account to see if the issue is user-specific.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Application Policy**: Organizations can manage consent policies based on security needs. Communicate with your IT security team to understand these policies.
- **Compliance and Privacy**: Ensure that consent screens highlight what permissions are being asked and how user data will be handled.

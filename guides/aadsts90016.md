#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify the Context of the Error:**
   - Determine when the error occurs (e.g., during authentication, accessing an API).
   - Note whether the error is consistent or intermittent.

2. **Check the Access Token:**
   - Use a tool like [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/) to decode the access token.
   - Verify the claims present in the token against the claims expected by the application.

3. **Review the Application Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the application is registered correctly in Azure AD.
   - Check for any recent changes in app registration settings that may have affected token generation.

4. **Review Logs:**
   - Check the logs of the application requesting the token.
   - Look for any specific events or exceptions related to the authentication process.

#### Common Issues Causing AADSTS90016

1. **Missing Required Claims:**
   - The access token does not contain required claims such as `scp` (scope), `roles`, or other custom claims necessary for the application.

2. **Invalid Application Permissions:**
   - The API or application might not be granted sufficient permissions in Azure AD.

3. **Token Issued with Incorrect Scopes:**
   - The request for the access token may not include the necessary scopes that correspond to the claims expected by the application.

4. **Changes in Azure AD Policies:**
   - Updates in Azure AD configurations, policies, or permissions that might affect token issuance.

5. **User Not Assigned to the App:**
   - The user attempting to access the application may not have been granted access or assigned to the app role.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Check Required Claims:**
   - Review the token claims expected by your application as specified in the application code or configuration.
   - Update your application request if necessary to include missing claims.

2. **Modify API Permissions:**
   - Go to the Azure portal and navigate to "App registrations".
   - Choose the relevant application and select "API permissions".
   - Ensure all necessary permissions are granted and that admin consent is provided if needed.

3. ** Adjust Scopes in Token Request:**
   - Configure the application to request the right scopes in the authentication flow.
   - Update the code to ensure itâ€™s requesting the required scopes when generating the access token.

4. **Assign Users to the Application (if applicable):**
   - For enterprise applications, ensure that all users needing access have the correct assignments.
   - Check under "Enterprise applications" and go to the "Users and groups" section to manage assignments.

5. **Check Azure AD Policies:**
   - Review Azure AD policies and make any necessary updates or adjustments that may affect token claims issuance.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- If using custom claims within your application, confirm that your domain has been set up correctly for issuing claims.
- Evaluate your authentication libraries or SDKs (e.g., MSAL, ADAL) to ensure they are up-to-date and correctly configured.

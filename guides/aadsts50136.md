# AADSTS50136: RedirectMsaSessionToApp - Single MSA session detected.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The error code `AADSTS50136` indicates an issue with authentication that arises when a single Microsoft account (MSA) session is detected, which prevents the application from completing the authentication process. This error is generally encountered in scenarios involving Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Microsoft user accounts. Hereâ€™s a structured troubleshooting guide:

### Detailed Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50136

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify the context**: Determine what application or service is being accessed when the error occurs.
2. **Gather user details**: Confirm which user account is encountering the issue and verify if the user has multiple sessions or accounts logged in.
3. **Check the application type**: Ensure the application being accessed supports MSA and AAD authentication. 

#### Common Issues that Cause this Error

1. **Multiple account conflicts**: User is logged into multiple Microsoft accounts and the session cannot resolve which account to use.
2. **Browser caching issues**: Old sessions or cache in the browser may interfere with the login process.
3. **Explicit account type issue**: The application may not have been properly configured to handle both MSA and work/school accounts.
4. **Session timeout or inertness**: The session may be stale or expired, leading to redirections to the login page.
5. **Application redirection configurations**: Incorrect or missing redirect URIs in the application's AAD configuration.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Log Out of All Accounts**:
   - Log out from all Microsoft accounts on the browser or application being used. You can clear the sessions for a fresh start.

2. **Clear Browser Cache and Cookies**:
   - Clear the cache and cookies for the browser you are using. This can help eliminate stale session data.
   - **For Chrome**: `Settings` > `Privacy and security` > `Clear browsing data` > Select `Cookies and other site data` and `Cached images and files`.

3. **Try an InPrivate or Incognito Window**:
   - Open a new session in incognito mode (for Chrome) or private browsing mode (for Firefox) to avoid cached sessions or cookies interfering with the login.

4. **Check for Multiple Accounts**:
   - Ensure you are only logged into the intended Microsoft account. If necessary, remove any unwanted accounts from the browser.

5. **Review Application Configuration**:
   - Verify the redirect URIs configured for the Azure app registration are correct and include all necessary endpoints.

6. **Examine Authentication Method**:
   - Ensure that the authentication method being used is supported and properly configured in Azure AD.

7. **Session Management**:
   - Investigate if anything from your system is altering session management for the user accounts.

8. **Attempt Access from Different Devices/Networks**:
   - Try accessing the application from a different device or network to isolate any network-related issues.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Time Synchronization**: Ensure the device time is synced with an internet time server to avoid authentication timeouts.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Some older versions of browsers may not handle modern authentication flows correctly. Ensure you are using an updated browser for testing.
- **Security Policies**: Network and security policies (VPNs, firewalls) might affect how sessions are created. Review these if problems persist.

#### Documentation for Guidance

- **Microsoft Documentation**: 
  - [Azure AD Error Codes Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aad-errors)
  - [Overview of Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview)
  - [Authentication Flows in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)

#### Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer, NetTrace, Fiddler)

- **Event Viewer**: 
  - Check for any related errors in **Event Viewer** under `Windows Logs > Application` and `Security`.
  
- **Network Traces**:
  - Use **NetTrace** tools to capture network traffic while trying to authenticate. Analyze the output for any redirection or failure patterns.
  
- **Fiddler**:
  - Utilize **Fiddler** to monitor HTTP requests and responses while attempting to log in. Look for status codes, redirections, or error messages in the responses.

### Conclusion

This error can often be resolved by clearing out conflicting sessions or ensuring that the proper accounts are being utilized in line with application expectations. Following this structured guide should help in diagnosing and resolving issues related to the AADSTS50136 error effectively.

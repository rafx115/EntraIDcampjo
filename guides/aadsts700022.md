# AADSTS700022: InvalidMultipleResourcesScope - The provided value for the input parameter scope isn't valid because it contains more than one resource.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS700022

The error code `AADSTS700022` indicates that there is an issue with the scopes requested for an Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication. Specifically, it means that your request includes more than one resource in the scope parameter, which is not allowed.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Review the Error Message:**
   - Confirm that the error code is indeed `AADSTS700022` and note the description which states the problem is related to multiple resource scopes.

2. **Identify the Source:**
   - Determine the application or service that is encountering the error.
   - Check for logs or reports of when the error occurs (e.g., user login attempts, service access).

3. **Examine Scope Parameter:**
   - Locate the authentication request (typically in your application code).
   - Look for the `scope` parameter sent during the OAuth2 authorization request.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Incorrectly Formatted Scope Request:**
   - The `scope` parameter should be formatted as a space-separated string of permissions for a **single** resource.

2. **Multiple Resources in Scope:**
   - Specifying scopes for different resources in one request. For example, including both `api://resource1/.default` and `api://resource2/.default` in the same request.

3. **Misunderstanding of OAuth2 Flow:**
   - Not understanding the limitations on scope for a given authentication request can lead to incorrectly structured requests.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Check Resource and Scope Setup:**
   - Go to the Azure portal and check that you have defined the resources and scopes correctly in the **App Registration** section.

2. **Modify Scope Parameter:**
   - Ensure your request for authorization includes scopes for only a single resource:
     - E.g., `scope=api://resource_id/.default` is valid.
     - Combining scopes like `api://resource1/.default api://resource2/.default` is invalid.

3. **Update Application Code:**
   - If using a library (like MSAL), ensure that the `scope` parameter is constructed properly:
     ```javascript
     const request = {
         scopes: ["api://your_single_resource/.default"],
     };
     ```

4. **Test Authentication Flow:**
   - After making changes, run through the authentication flow again to ensure that the error is resolved.

5. **Check API Permissions:**
   - Ensure that the application has the necessary permissions configured for the single resource being accessed, and that those permissions have been granted by an admin if required.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Group permissions in Azure AD are not the same as application permissions. Make sure you differentiate between them when configuring your app registration.
- When requesting user consent, make sure the scopes you present fall within the scope of the application's permissions.

- [MSAL.js Documentation](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js)

#### Advice for Data Collection

If you need to collect data to diagnose the issue further and gather logs:

1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - Check the Windows Event Viewer under Applications and Services Logs for any related entries.

2. **Fiddler:**
   - Use Fiddler to inspect the outgoing HTTP requests being sent to Azure. This can help verify the exact structure of your authentication requests.

3. **Network Traces:**
   - Employ network tracing (NetTrace) tools to capture and analyze network traffic, ensuring that requests to Azure AAD are correctly formatted.

By following this troubleshooting guide, you should be able to identify and resolve the AADSTS700022 error efficiently.

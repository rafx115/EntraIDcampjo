# AADSTS120000: PasswordChangeIncorrectCurrentPassword


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS120000: PasswordChangeIncorrectCurrentPassword

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Verify User Identity**: Ensure you are attempting to change the password for the correct user account.
2. **Check the Current Password**: Confirm that you are entering the current password correctly. Pay attention to:
   - Case sensitivity
   - Special characters
   - Spaces
3. **Reproduce the Error**: Attempt to change the password again to verify that the error occurs consistently under the same conditions.
4. **Review Time Stamps**: Ensure that the account is not locked due to multiple failed attempts in a short time frame.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error:
- **Incorrect Current Password**: The most common cause of this error is entering the wrong current password.
- **Password Expiration**: If the password has expired, the current password must be provided, otherwise, the user must use the reset password flow.
- **Account Lockout**: An account may be temporarily locked after multiple failed login attempts, impacting password change capabilities.
- **Synchronization Issues**: For hybrid environments, delays in synchronizing password changes between on-premises Active Directory and Azure Active Directory can cause issues.
- **Security Policies**: Organizational password policies may require certain complexities that are not being met.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Confirm Credentials**:
   - Double-check the current password and ensure it's the correct one for the account.
   - Consider resetting the password through a known secure method if you cannot remember it.

2. **Clear Browser Cache (if applicable)**:
   - Clear the browser cache and cookies.
   - Try to change the password from a different browser or private/incognito mode.

3. **Use Password Reset**:
   - If the current password cannot be confirmed, initiate a password reset through appropriate procedures in your organization.
   - Follow the prompts to validate identity via security questions, email, or SMS.

4. **Check for Account Lockout**:
   - Use administrative tools to check if the account is locked or disabled due to failed login attempts.
   - If locked, unlock the account through administrative interfaces.

5. **Review Password Policies**:
   - Ensure that the new password being set complies with corporate password policies (length, complexity, etc.).
   - Educate users on these policies to avoid future issues.

6. **Sync Troubleshooting (if applicable)**:
   - For hybrid setups, check that Azure AD Connect is functioning correctly and that synchronization is occurring as expected.
   - Use the Azure AD Connect Health tool to diagnose and address sync issues.

7. **Engage Azure AD Support**:
   - If the error persists after all steps, escalate the issue by contacting Azure AD support for further investigation.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: If the account is set up with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), ensure the MFA is functioning correctly and that the user has access to the second-factor authentication method.
- **User Education**: Encourage users to use the password manager or document their passwords securely to avoid lockouts in the future.

#### Advice for Data Collection:
- **Event Viewer Logs**: Review the Event Viewer on Windows servers to see if there are relevant logs regarding authentication or password changes.
  - Look under Windows Logs -> Security and Application logs for any relevant messages from Azure AD Connect and authentication events.

- **Network Traces with Nettrace or Fiddler**:
  - If troubleshooting network issues, consider capturing traffic using Fiddler or a similar tool to identify any app errors during authentication.
  - Analyze the captured traffic for any error messages or failed API calls related to password changes.

- **Important**: Ensure any data collected complies with your organization's policies on data privacy and security.

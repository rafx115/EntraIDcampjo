Error Code: AADSTS120000 Description: PasswordChangeIncorrectCurrentPassword

Initial Diagnostic Steps:

1. Verify that the user is entering the correct current password.
2. Ensure there are no typing errors or character confusion in the password
   entry.
3. Confirm that the account is not locked due to multiple failed login attempts.
4. Check if the password reset option is available and working properly.

Common Issues that Cause this Error:

1. User mistyped their current password.
2. User's account may be locked or disabled.
3. User may have recently changed their password on another device or platform.
4. Incorrect synchronization between the user's device and the authentication
   server.
5. Password expiration policy enforcement causing confusion.

Step-by-step Resolution Strategies:

1. Have the user reset their password: a. Direct the user to the password reset
   option on the login page. b. Follow the prompts to reset the password,
   ensuring the user enters the correct current password.

2. Unlock the user account: a. Check if the user's account is locked or
   disabled. b. If locked, unlock the account using the administrative tools or
   by contacting the system administrator.

3. Verify password synchronization: a. Recommend the user to log out and log
   back in to synchronize the password with the authentication server. b. If the
   error persists, ask the user to clear browser cache and cookies before
   attempting to log in again.

4. Check password expiration policy: a. Inform the user if there are any
   password expiration policies in place. b. Advise the user to follow the
   password reset process if the password has expired.

Additional Notes or Considerations:

* Encourage users to use password managers to avoid mistyping passwords.
* Educate users about the importance of keeping their passwords secure and not
  sharing them with others.
* Monitor for any ongoing issues with the authentication system and escalate to
  higher support levels if needed.
* Keep user communication clear and provide detailed instructions to resolve the
  error easily.

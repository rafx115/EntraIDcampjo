**Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS500213 Error:
NotAllowedByInboundPolicyTenant**

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:**

1. Verify the exact error message received by the user.
2. Confirm the user's credentials by checking the username/email and password
   used for authentication.
3. Check if the user is trying to access resources across different Azure AD
   tenants.
4. Determine the specific application or service that is causing the error.
5. Confirm the user's permissions and role assignments in both the resource
   tenant and the target tenant.

**Common Issues that Cause this Error:**

1. User does not have the necessary permissions or roles granted to access the
   target tenant.
2. Cross-tenant access policies are not correctly configured in Azure AD.
3. Conditional Access policies or other security settings blocking the user's
   access to resources in the target tenant.
4. Mismatch in user's UPN (User Principal Name) or tenant domain across the
   tenants.
5. Issues with Application registrations and permissions set up in Azure AD.

**Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:**

1. **Check User Permissions:** Ensure that the user has been granted the
   necessary permissions or roles in both the resource and target tenants.
2. **Review Cross-Tenant Access Policies:** Verify and update the cross-tenant
   access policies in Azure AD to allow the user to access resources in the
   target tenant.
3. **Validate Conditional Access Policies:** Review and adjust any Conditional
   Access policies that may be blocking the user's access to the target tenant.
4. **Verify User's UPN and Domain:** Ensure that the user's UPN and tenant
   domain are consistent across both tenants.
5. **Review Application Permissions:** Check the permissions assigned to the
   application or service that the user is trying to access and ensure they are
   correctly configured in both tenants.
6. **Re-authenticate the User:** Have the user sign out and sign back in to
   trigger a fresh authentication attempt.
7. **Contact Azure AD Administrator:** If the issue persists, escalate to the
   Azure AD administrator for further assistance in troubleshooting and
   resolving the error.

**Additional Notes or Considerations:**

* Keep track of any recent changes made to user permissions, policies, or
  configurations that may have triggered the error.
* Regularly review and update cross-tenant access policies and permissions to
  align with the organization's security requirements.
* Communicate with the user about the error message and provide guidance on how
  to resolve or escalate the issue if needed.

# AADSTS500213: NotAllowedByInboundPolicyTenant - The resource tenant's cross-tenant access policy doesn't allow this user to access this tenant.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS500213

#### Overview
The error code **AADSTS500213** indicates that the user's attempt to access a resource in a target tenant is blocked due to a cross-tenant access policy applied in the resource (target) tenant. This typically arises in Azure Active Directory (AAD) in scenarios involving multi-tenant applications or services.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Verify User's Account**: Ensure that the user's account is valid and they are trying to authenticate with the correct credentials.
2. **Check Source Tenant Settings**: Determine the tenant from which the user is attempting to access the resource. This could be the user's home tenant.
3. **Identify Target Resource**: Note which resource or application the user is trying to access. This could be an Azure service, Microsoft application, or a custom application.
4. **Review Error Message**: Analyze the full context of the error message received for any additional clues regarding the policy applied in the target tenant.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error
- **Cross-Tenant Access Policies**: The target tenant has strict policies that block all inbound requests from users in other tenants, which may include block lists or specific settings disallowing access.
- **User Roles and Permissions**: The user may not have been assigned the necessary roles or permissions within the target tenant.
- **Incorrect OAuth Configuration**: Misconfigured application registration settings might lead to authorization failures, such as incorrect redirect URIs or permissions.
- **Conditional Access Policies**: The target tenant might enforce Conditional Access policies that require certain conditions to be met before allowing access.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Check the Cross-Tenant Policy in the Target Tenant**:
   - Admins of the resource tenant need to log into the Azure Portal and navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **External Identities** > **Cross-tenant access settings**.
   - Verify if the inbound policy allows access for users from the specific tenant or if there are restrictions that need to be modified.

2. **Review User Permissions**:
   - Ensure that the user has the appropriate roles assigned for accessing the application in the target tenant.
   - Check if the application in question is listed under the userâ€™s assigned applications.

3. **Application Registration Settings**:
   - Confirm that the application is properly registered in the Azure Portal.
   - Validate the API permissions, ensuring that they are correct and that admin consent has been granted if required.

4. **Audit Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Review any Conditional Access policies that may prevent access based on user location, device state, or other security requirements.

5. **Testing Access**:
   - Conduct tests using different user accounts across tenants to identify if the problem is user-specific or a broader issue.

6. **Coordinating with Tenant Admins**:
   - If you are not an admin of the target tenant, contact the administrators of that tenant to review and potentially modify access policies.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Cross-tenant policies can be restrictive for security reasons; changes should be made with careful consideration of their implications.
- Keep in mind that even if the user's credentials are correct, restrictions may still apply based on organizational security postures.

### Documentation Where Steps Can Be Found
- [Azure Active Directory Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/)
- [Manage Cross-Tenant Access Settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/cross-tenant-access-policy)
- [Conditional Access and Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview)

### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**:
  - Access the Event Viewer (`eventvwr.msc`) on the user's device to check logs related to authentication and application access for relevant error codes.
  
- **Network Tracing**:
  - **NetTrace**: You can use tools like Wireshark or Microsoft Message Analyzer to capture network traffic during the authentication process.
  
- **Fiddler**:
  - Enable Fiddler to inspect HTTP requests/responses. Particularly useful when testing web applications that authenticate with AAD. Look for error messages or issues in the headers that indicate policy constraints.

### Conclusion
By following this guide, you should be able to troubleshoot and address the AADSTS500213 error effectively. Collaborating with tenant administrators is often key to resolving cross-tenant policy-related issues.

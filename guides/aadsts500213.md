## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS500213: NotAllowedByInboundPolicyTenant

**Description**: This error occurs when the cross-tenant access policy of the resource tenant restricts the user from accessing the target tenant.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. Verify the user's access rights and permissions in the target tenant.
2. Check the cross-tenant access policy settings in the resource tenant.
3. Ensure that the user is correctly authenticated and authorized to access the resource.

#### Common Issues:
- Misconfigured cross-tenant access policies.
- User not assigned the correct roles or permissions in the target tenant.
- Authentication issues leading to access restrictions.
- Tenant trust and federation issues.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Check User Permissions**:
   - Verify that the user has been granted the necessary roles or permissions in the target tenant.

2. **Review Cross-Tenant Access Policies**:
   - In the resource tenant's Azure AD portal, check the cross-tenant access policies to ensure the user is permitted to access the target tenant.

3. **Refresh Authentication**:
   - Have the user sign out and then sign back in to refresh their authentication token. This can sometimes resolve access issues.

4. **Reset Permissions**:
   - If the permissions were recently updated, try resetting the user's permissions in both the resource and target tenants.

5. **Contact Administrator**:
   - If the issue persists, contact the Azure AD administrator of the resource tenant to investigate further.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- Cross-tenant access policies are a security feature designed to prevent unauthorized access between tenants.
- Ensure that any changes made to permissions and access policies are correctly configured and documented.

#### Documentation:

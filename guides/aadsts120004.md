## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS120004: "PasswordChangeOnPremComplexity"

**Overview**  
The error code AADSTS120004 with the description "PasswordChangeOnPremComplexity" indicates that a user's password change attempt has failed due to on-premises complexity requirements not being met. This is typically encountered in scenarios involving Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) where password change requests were routed through Azure AD for on-premises accounts.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify the User**: Confirm the identity of the user facing the issue.
2. **Reproduce the Issue**: Attempt to reproduce the error with the same user's credentials.
3. **Check the Context**: Determine if the user is trying to change their password via a specific application or directly through the Azure portal.
4. **Review the Error Message**: Carefully review any additional details provided with the error message for further hints.

### Common Issues that Cause this Error

1. **Password Complexity Requirements**: The user's new password does not meet the complexity requirements defined by the on-premises Active Directory.
2. **Synchronization Issues**: Problems with the synchronization between on-premises Active Directory and Azure AD (e.g., Azure AD Connect).
3. **User Account State**: The user's account may be locked, disabled, or in a stale state.
4. **Expired Passwords**: The user’s password may have expired, and they are unable to set a new one without meeting the required criteria.
5. **Policy Enforcement**: Group policies related to password complexity may be too restrictive.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Check Password Complexity Requirements**:
   - Review the password policy in Active Directory:
     - At a minimum, passwords should include:
       - At least 8 characters (configurable)
       - Uppercase letters
       - Lowercase letters
       - Numbers
       - Special characters

2. **Validate Password Change Attempts**:
   - Ask the user to attempt a password change using the following steps:
     - Use the on-premises password change mechanism (e.g., Ctrl + Alt + Del > Change a password).
     - Ensure they attempt to meet all complexity requirements.

3. **Check Account Status**:
   - Use Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) to check if the user account is:
     - Locked out
     - Disabled
     - Active and not expired

4. **Review Synchronization Status**:
   - Ensure Azure AD Connect is functioning properly:
     - Check synchronization logs.
     - You can do this from the Azure AD Connect Health portal if available.
   - Use the Azure AD Connect tool to force a re-sync if needed.

5. **Use Microsoft Password Checker**:
   - Guide the user to utilize a password complexity checking tool (such as Microsoft's) to verify if their desired password meets the requirements.

6. **Contact IT Support**:
   - If the problem persists after following the above steps, escalate the issue to IT support for further diagnostics and possible intervention.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Some organizations may have custom or stricter password policies than the default. Ensure that you are familiar with any additional rules your organization may impose.
- If integration with services like Office 365 is critically involved, consider checking for service interruptions that may affect password writes.

### Documentation Where Steps Can Be Found for Guidance

- [Microsoft Docs: Password policies in Windows Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/policy/policy-options)
- [Azure AD Connect: Sync Status](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-install-new)
- [Troubleshooting password changes in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/tshoot-connect-password-change)

### Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer Logs, Nettrace, Fiddler)

1. **Event Viewer**:
   - Check the “Security” and “Application” logs for any errors or warnings related to the user's account, password changes, or Azure AD Connect.
   
2. **Nettrace**:
   - Use tools like Network Monitor or Wireshark to capture network traces during the password change attempt. Look for errors indicating connection refusal or unexpected redirects.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - If your password change is performed through a web app, use Fiddler to capture HTTP/HTTPS traffic to look for any failed requests or errors indicating what might be going wrong.

4. **Document Findings**:
   - Keep a detailed log of all findings and errors to assist IT support if further escalation is necessary.

By following these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue associated with the error AADSTS120004 effectively.

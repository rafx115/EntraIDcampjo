# AADSTS130004: NgcKeyNotFound - The user principal doesn't have the NGC ID key configured.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The error code AADSTS130004, with the description "NgcKeyNotFound - The user principal doesn't have the NGC ID key configured," typically relates to issues around Windows Hello for Business or Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authenticated applications. Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide structured as per your request.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify the Context**: Determine where the error is occurring – is it during user login, application access, or accessing specific resources?
  
2. **Check User Principal**: Verify the user principal (UPN) of the account facing the issue. Confirm it's the account expected and ensure it has the correct configurations in Azure AD.

3. **Review Error Logs**: If available, check the logs (Event Viewer for Windows environments, Azure AD sign-in logs) for additional context around the error.

4. **Browser and Network Environment**: If applicable, assess if the issue persists across different browsers, devices, or networks.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **NGC Key Not Configured**: The user's account doesn't have a corresponding NGC Key set up. This typically occurs with users who haven't registered for Windows Hello for Business.

2. **Intune Policy Misconfiguration**: If using Intune, there might be a misconfiguration in policies related to Windows Hello for Business.

3. **Azure AD Configuration**: Issues could arise from the Azure Active Directory configuration, particularly if it's not set up to allow Windows Hello.

4. **Sync Issues**: If the account is synced from on-premises Active Directory, ensure sync is working correctly and keys are being pushed to Azure AD.

5. **Device Compliance**: The device the user is trying to log in from may not meet compliance requirements as set by Intune or Azure AD.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **User Registration for Windows Hello**:
   - Instruct the user to set up Windows Hello for Business. This can be done via Settings:
     - Go to **Settings** > **Accounts** > **Sign-in options**.
     - Under Windows Hello, they can select `Set up` for Fingerprint, Face, or PIN as appropriate.

2. **Azure AD Configuration**:
   - Check if Windows Hello for Business is enabled in Azure AD:
     - Go to the Azure portal, navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Devices** > **Windows Hello for Business**.
     - Ensure the policy settings are correct and policies are applied to the user.

3. **Verify Intune Policy**:
   - If using Microsoft Intune, check if there are any Windows Hello for Business policies in your configuration profiles. Ensure that they are assigned to the relevant users/groups.

4. **Sync Issues**:
   - If Active Directory is synced with Azure AD, check the Azure AD Connect logs for any issues. Ensure the NGC keys are synced correctly.
   - Run a "Full Sync" if necessary.

5. **Testing Device Compliance**:
   - Ensure the device meets any compliance policies defined in Intune. The user can check this under **Settings** > **Accounts** > **Access work or school**, and ensure the device is compliant.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- It may take some time after setting up Windows Hello for Business for the NGC keys to appear in Azure AD.
- Ensure that the client OS is up to date, as older versions may have bugs or lack support for certain features.

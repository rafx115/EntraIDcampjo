# AADSTS80010: OnPremisePasswordValidationEncryptionException - The Authentication Agent is unable to decrypt password.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS80010: OnPremisePasswordValidationEncryptionException

The error code **AADSTS80010** indicates that there is an issue with the authentication process between Azure Active Directory (AAD) and your on-premises environment, specifically that the Authentication Agent is unable to decrypt passwords. This may arise from several potential causes, such as incorrect encryption keys or issues with the Authentication Agent itself.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check Service Health:** 
   - Visit the Azure Service Health dashboard to check if there are any ongoing service disruptions in Azure Active Directory or other related services.

2. **Verify Connectivity:** 
   - Ensure that the AAD Connect server can communicate with Azure AD and the on-premises domain controller.

3. **Review Configuration:**
   - Verify the configuration of AAD Connect, especially the settings for password hash synchronization or pass-through authentication.

4. **Check for Recent Changes:**
   - Determine if any recent changes were made to the environment, such as updates to the AAD Connect configuration, updates to the Authentication Agent, or changes to security policies.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **Encryption Key Issues:**
   - The encryption keys used by the Authentication Agent might not be consistent or might be outdated.
   
2. **Outdated Authentication Agent:**
   - An outdated version of the Azure AD Authentication Agent could lead to compatibility problems.

3. **Configuration Errors:**
   - Incorrect configuration in AAD Connect for password validation can lead to this error.

4. **Network Issues:**
   - Intermittent network connectivity issues between the Authentication Agent and Azure AD can cause authentication failures.

5. **Multiple Authentication Agents:**
   - If there are multiple Authentication Agents, check for consistency in their configurations.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Update the Authentication Agent:**
   - Ensure that you are running the latest version of the Azure AD Authentication Agent. If an update is available, download and install it.

2. **Check Encryption Key Configuration:**
   - On the server running the Authentication Agent, verify that the encryption keys are correctly set up.
   - Use the Azure AD Connect Wizard to check the configuration, especially the settings for pass-through authentication.

3. **Repair or Reconfigure AAD Connect:**
   - If there are issues with the AAD Connect configuration:
     - Run the AAD Connect setup wizard and select the option to repair.
     - Verify that all settings related to password validation or synchronization are correctly configured.

4. **Review Event Logs:**
   - Check the Windows Event Logs on the server running the Authentication Agent for any related error messages or warnings.

5. **Network Diagnostics:**
   - Ensure there are no network connectivity issues. Use tools like `ping`, `tracert`, or `telnet` to check connectivity between the Authentication Agent and Azure AD.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

1. **Review Documentation:**
   - Confirm that all components of your setup (AAD Connect, Authentication Agent, etc.) are configured following the official Microsoft guidelines.

2. **Backup Configuration:**
   - Always maintain backups of your AAD Connect configuration before making significant changes or upgrades.

3. **Monitor Performance:**
   - Keep an eye on the performance of your Authentication Agents and the frequency of authentication requests, especially during high-load periods.

4. **Security Settings:**
   - Ensure that no security policies are preventing the Authentication Agent from functioning correctly.

#### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - Collect logs from the Event Viewer, especially under “Applications and Services Logs” > “Microsoft” > “AzureAD” and “AzureADAuthentication”.

2. **Network Tracing:**
   - Use tools like `Nettrace` to capture network traffic between the Authentication Agent and Azure AD.

3. **Fiddler:**
   - If appropriate, use Fiddler to inspect HTTP(S) calls made by the Authentication Agent to Azure AD, looking for any issues or unusual responses.

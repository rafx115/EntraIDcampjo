Error Code: AADSTS80010 - OnPremisePasswordValidationEncryptionException

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:**

1. Verify the exact error message and error code received.
2. Check the authentication logs for more detailed information on the error.
3. Confirm if the issue is consistently reproducible or sporadic.
4. Ensure all relevant configuration settings are correctly set up for the
   Authentication Agent.

**Common Issues Leading to this Error:**

1. Incorrect encryption key or password used for decryption.
2. Misconfigured Authentication Agent settings.
3. Issues with the integration between the Authentication Agent and the identity
   provider.
4. Authentication Agent not installed or configured properly.
5. Changes or updates in the encryption algorithm used by the Authentication
   Agent.

**Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:**

1. **Validate Encryption Key and Password:**

   * Verify that the encryption key and password used for decryption are
     correct.
   * Ensure that the encryption key has not been changed or updated without
     corresponding updates in the configuration.

2. **Check Authentication Agent Configuration:**

   * Review the configuration settings of the Authentication Agent to ensure
     they are accurate.
   * Check for any misconfigurations that might be causing the decryption error.

3. **Update Authentication Agent:**

   * If possible, update the Authentication Agent to the latest version.
   * Updates sometimes include bug fixes or enhancements that could address
     decryption issues.

4. **Restart Authentication Agent Service:**

   * Try restarting the Authentication Agent service to see if it resolves the
     decryption problem.
   * Sometimes, a simple restart can clear temporary issues causing decryption
     failures.

5. **Test in a Controlled Environment:**
   * Create a test environment where you can simulate the decryption process to
     identify the exact point of failure.
   * Use logging and monitoring tools to track the decryption process and
     pinpoint the issue.

**Additional Notes or Considerations:**

* Engage with the support team of the Authentication Agent vendor for detailed
  assistance.
* Ensure that the encryption algorithm and standards used are supported by both
  the Authentication Agent and the identity provider.
* Regularly monitor logs and system health to catch any potential decryption
  issues early.
* Document any changes made during troubleshooting for future reference.

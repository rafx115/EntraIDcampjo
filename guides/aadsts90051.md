## Troubleshooting Steps
## Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS90051 - InvalidNationalCloudId

### Description
The AADSTS90051 error indicates that the identifier provided for a national cloud is invalid. This typically occurs when applications attempt to authenticate against Azure Active Directory (AAD) using an incorrect or unsupported national cloud endpoint.

### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps

- **Verify the Error Context**: Confirm when the error occurs. Is it during user authentication, API calls, etc.?
- **Examine the Cloud Identifier**: Identify the national cloud identifier that was used in the request. It should conform to the expected formats.
- **Check Logs**: Review application and authentication logs to gather additional context around the error.
- **Replication of the Issue**: Attempt to reproduce the error under controlled conditions.

### 2. Common Issues That Cause This Error

- **Invalid National Cloud Identifier**: Incorrect national cloud identifiers used in the application configuration.
- **Misconfigured Authentication Requests**: Incorrectly formed requests to the Azure AD service endpoints.
- **Outdated SDK or Library**: Use of outdated libraries or SDKs that may not support the current cloud identifiers.
- **Incorrect Tenant Configuration**: Tenant configurations that do not align with the national cloud being accessed.
- **Lack of Permissions**: The application may not have the appropriate permissions set up in the Azure portal.

### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Identify and Verify the National Cloud Identifier**:
   - Confirm that you are using the correct national cloud identifier. Common valid identifiers for national clouds include:
     - `https://login.microsoftonline.us` for the United States
     - `https://login.chinacloudapi.cn` for China
     - `https://login.microsoftonline.de` for Germany
     - Other specific identifiers for different nations.

2. **Review Application Configuration**:
   - Check application registration settings in the Azure portal.
   - Ensure that your application's configuration aligns with the correct national cloud. Look for the `authority` URL and validate it against the correct format for your cloud.

3. **Update SDKs and Libraries**:
   - Ensure you are using the latest versions of any SDKs or libraries related to Azure AD, as they may have fixes for national cloud identifiers.

4. **Tenant Configuration**:
   - Log into the Azure portal, ensure that your tenant is properly configured for the national cloud you are trying to access. You may want to contact Azure support if the configuration seems incorrect.

5. **Check API Permissions**:
   - Ensure that the application has the necessary API permissions granted in the Azure portal to authenticate against Azure services.

6. **Testing and Validation**:
   - After making the necessary adjustments, attempt to authenticate again to ensure that the issue has been resolved. Monitor logs closely for any persistence of the error.

### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Environment Specific**: National clouds are intended for specific regions with compliance and data residency requirements. Ensure you are accessing the appropriate service endpoints.
- **Use Official Documentation**: Always refer to the official Azure documentation for updates on national clouds and instructions for configuration.
  
### 5. Documentation Where Steps Can Be Found

- [Azure Active Directory Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/)
- [Configure your app to use the Azure AD national clouds](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-national-clouds) (directly addresses issues with national cloud configurations).

### 6. Test Documentation Reachability

- Access the provided links or documentation directly through a web browser or a reverse proxy to confirm that they are live and accessible. 

### 7. Advice for Data Collection

To assist in troubleshooting future issues, consider collecting the following data:
- **Request and Response Logs**: Capture all requests made to Azure AD and the corresponding responses, including headers and body content.
- **Environment Details**: Document your existing infrastructure, including SDK versions, cloud identifiers in use, and Azure tenant properties.
- **User Context**: Gather information about which users were impacted, including their permissions and roles.

By following this guide, you should be able to effectively diagnose and resolve the AADSTS90051 error related to invalid national cloud identifiers.

# AADSTS90051: InvalidNationalCloudId - The national cloud identifier contains an invalid cloud identifier.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Here’s a detailed troubleshooting guide for the error code AADSTS90051, which indicates an invalid national cloud identifier in Azure Active Directory (AAD).

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS90051

#### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps
- **Check the Error Message:**
  - Ensure to fully read and understand the error context provided with the AADSTS90051 code.
  
- **Identify the Context:**
  - Determine when the error occurs (e.g., during authentication, token acquisition, or API calls).
  
- **Review the Application Configuration:**
  - Check if the application requires specific configurations regarding national cloud identifiers.

#### 2. Common Issues that Cause This Error
- **Incorrect National Cloud URL:**
  - If an application is configured to use a specific national cloud (like Azure Germany or Azure China), ensure the identifier is valid and correct.
  
- **Misconfigured Directory/Subscription:**
  - Ensure that your Azure AD tenant is correctly set up for the intended national cloud.

- **Service Principal Configuration:**
  - Verify that any service principal registrations in Azure AD are aligned with the expected national cloud.

- **User Credentials:**
  - Confirm that the user’s credentials are valid and belong to the correct Azure AD tenant.

#### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
- **Step 1: Verify National Cloud Identifier**
  - Compare the identifier you are using against the official list provided by Microsoft for national clouds. For instance, Azure Government, Azure Germany, and Azure China each have unique identifiers.

- **Step 2: Confirm Azure AD Tenant Settings**
  - Log in to Azure Portal and check your Azure Active Directory settings. Ensure that the tenant is in the correct national cloud region.
  
- **Step 3: Check Application Registration**
  - In the Azure Portal, navigate to "Azure Active Directory" > "App registrations" > (select your application). Ensure that the required API permissions and redirect URIs conform to the national cloud settings.

- **Step 4: Validate Service Principal Permissions**
  - Under "Enterprise applications" in Azure AD, check the service principal's permissions and ensure that they are correctly set for the national cloud.

- **Step 5: Test with Different Users**
  - If possible, try authenticating with different user accounts. This will help determine if the issue is isolated to specific user accounts.

- **Step 6: Check Timestamp and Timezone Settings**
  - Ensure that your client systems have correct time settings. An incorrect time can cause token validation failures.

#### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Understanding National Clouds:**
  - Make sure you understand the implications of using national clouds and how they differ from public cloud deployments in Azure.

- **Documentation Review:**
  - Familiarize yourself with Microsoft documentation regarding Azure Active Directory and national clouds.

#### 5. Documentation for Guidance
- **Azure Active Directory Documentation:**
  - [Azure AD Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-whats-new)
  - [National Clouds Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-cloud)
  - [Error Codes in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aad-error-codes#common-azure-ad-error-codes)

#### 6. Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs:**
  - Check the application logs in the Event Viewer for specific error messages related to authentication failures.
  
- **Network Traces:**
  - Use tools like `nettrace` to capture network packets if the error relates to network communications.
  
- **Fiddler:**
  - Monitor outgoing requests to see the detailed content and responses. Ensure that calls are being correctly directed to the appropriate national cloud endpoint.

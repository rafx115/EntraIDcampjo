# AADSTS130008: NgcDeviceIsNotFound - The device referenced by the NGC key wasn't found.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS130008: "NgcDeviceIsNotFound"

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Understand the Context**: Identify when the error occurs. Are users experiencing it during sign-in, accessing specific applications, or device registration?
  
2. **Check User Credentials**: Verify the user credentials to ensure they are correctly entered.

3. **Confirm Device Registration**: Ensure the user's device is properly registered with Azure AD and is not missing from the Azure AD device list.

4. **Review Conditional Access Policies**: Determine if there are conditional access policies that may be affecting the user's sign-in, particularly related to device compliance.

5. **Assess Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Examine if the user is required to complete additional authentication steps that may depend on the device.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error
- **Device Not Registered**: The user's device may not be registered with Azure AD.
- **Expired or Invalid NGC Key**: The Next Generation Credentials key required for multifactor authentication or device trust may not be valid or may not exist.
- **Misconfiguration in Azure AD**: Device sync or registration settings in Azure AD may be incorrectly configured.
- **User Account Issues**: The user account might be disabled or have insufficient permissions.
- **MFA Device Issues**: Problems with devices involved in MFA scenarios, such as a missing or unrecognized security key.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Verify Device Registration**:
   - Log into the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory > Devices > All Devices**.
   - Check if the userâ€™s device appears in the list. If not, proceed with device enrollment.

2. **Re-register the Device**:
   - On the device experiencing issues, sign out of any Azure AD accounts.
   - Re-enroll the device by going to **Settings > Accounts > Access work or school**, removing the account, and then adding it back.

3. **Check NGC Key**:
   - If the device supports Windows Hello, ensure that the NGC key is generated correctly. You can prompt the user to reconfigure Windows Hello.
   - Go to **Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options** and reconfigure the Windows Hello settings.

4. **Review Azure AD Conditional Access**:
   - In the Azure portal, examine any **Conditional Access** policies that may block device access.
   - Ensure that the computer complies with conditions set in these policies.

5. **Investigate User Account**:
   - Confirm that the user account is active and not disabled.
   - Ensure that the user is assigned the necessary licenses in Azure AD.

6. **Revoke and Re-establish MFA**:
   - If MFA is configured, consider revoking the MFA registration for the user and have them set it up again.

7. **Logs and Monitoring**:
   - Use Azure AD Sign-in logs to identify any anomalies during the sign-in process.
   - Look at Audit logs for any changes made to device registration or user accounts.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **User Education**: Educate users to check their Windows Hello setup. They should be aware that the device must support NGC for certain authentication methods.
  
- **Network Issues**: Ensure that there are no network issues preventing the device from communicating with Azure AD.

- **Compliance Status**: Ensure that the device meets compliance requirements to access organizational resources.

#### Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer, Nettrace, Fiddler)
- **Event Viewer**: Collect logs from the Event Viewer on the affected device, particularly under Application and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > User Device Registration.
- **Nettrace**: Capture network traces to analyze the network communication and request failures.
- **Fiddler**: Use Fiddler to inspect HTTP/HTTPS requests sent to Azure AD to see if there are any failing requests or unexpected behaviors in authentication flow.

Ensure to review and document any findings during these data collection processes to pinpoint the underlying cause of the error.

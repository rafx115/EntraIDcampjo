## Troubleshooting Steps

**Error Code: AADSTS81011** **Error Description:

DesktopSsoLookupUserBySidFailed - Unable to find user object based on

information in the user's Kerberos ticket.**

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:** 

1. Confirm that the user is experiencing the error consistently and not
   sporadically.
2. Verify if the user can log in using alternate authentication methods
   successfully.
3. Check if any recent changes in the network infrastructure or Active Directory
   policies might have triggered the error.
4. Gather detailed information about the user's environment, including the
   operating system, browser, and any additional security software in use.

**Common Issues That Cause This Error:** 

1. Misconfigured Kerberos ticket information.
2. Incorrect permissions or attributes in Active Directory preventing the user
   object lookup.
3. Network connectivity issues leading to failed authentication.
4. Synchronization problems between on-premises Active Directory and Azure
   Active Directory.
5. Expired Kerberos tickets or incorrect time settings on the client machine.

**Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:** 

1. **Refresh Kerberos Ticket:** 

   * Ask the user to log out and back in to refresh the Kerberos ticket.

   * If the issue persists, instruct the user to run 'klist purge' command to

     clear the current Kerberos tickets and try logging in again.

2. **Check User Object Attributes:** 

   * Verify the user object in Active Directory to ensure that all necessary

     attributes are correctly set.
   * Confirm that the user's SID (Security Identifier) is properly mapped and

     matches the information in the Kerberos ticket.

3. **Network Connectivity and Time Settings:** 

   * Check if there are any network disruptions or delays causing authentication

     failures.
   * Confirm that the client's time settings are synchronized with the domain

     controller.

4. **Sync Active Directory with Azure AD:** 

   * Ensure that there are no synchronization issues between the on-premises

     Active Directory and Azure Active Directory.
   * Trigger a manual sync or check the synchronization logs for any errors that

     might be affecting user lookup.

5. **Verify Permissions:**    * Ensure that the user has the necessary 
permissions to access the resource

     they are trying to authenticate to.
   * Check for any group memberships or access control settings that might be

     impacting the authentication process.

**Additional Notes or Considerations:**


* The error code AADSTS81011 usually indicates an issue with user authentication

  and lookup processes.

* If the issue persists after following the above steps, consider involving the

  IT support team or the Azure Active Directory admin for further investigation.

* Keep track of any changes made during the troubleshooting process to revert

  them if needed.

* Document the resolution steps and any findings to assist with future incidents

  or similar errors.

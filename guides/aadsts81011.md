# AADSTS81011: DesktopSsoLookupUserBySidFailed - Unable to find user object based on information in the user's Kerberos ticket.


## Troubleshooting Steps
## Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS81011 Error Code

### Error Description
**AADSTS81011**: The error indicates that the system is unable to find the user object based on information in the user's Kerberos ticket during a Desktop Single Sign-On (SSO) operation. This suggests issues with the integration of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and local Active Directory environments.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Verify User Authentication**:
   - Ensure the user is authenticated in Azure AD and that they can log in to other services.
   - Check if the user account has been synchronized from Active Directory correctly.

2. **Check Kerberos Ticket**:
   - Use the `klist` command on the client machine to check if a valid Kerberos ticket exists.
   - Make sure the ticket is not expired.

3. **Observe Error Logs**:
   - Look in the Azure AD logs and diagnostics to view more details surrounding the error.
   - Review the Event Viewer logs on the client machine under Applications and Services Logs -> Microsoft -> Windows -> Authentication.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error
- **User Not Found in Azure AD**: The specified user SID might not correspond to an existing Azure AD user.
- **Kerberos Configuration Issues**: Misconfiguration in the Kerberos ticketing system may cause a failure to identify the user.
- **SSL Communication Problems**: If there's an issue with SSL certificates or encryption settings, the service might not work properly.
- **Synchronization Issues**: The user object might not be synced between on-premises Active Directory and Azure AD.
- **Domain Policies**: Group policies in the local domain may restrict the generation or validation of Kerberos tickets.

### Step-by-step Resolution Strategies
#### Step 1: Check User Object Synchronization
1. Go to the Azure Active Directory Admin Center.
2. Verify if the user account exists in Azure AD and check for the SID matching the Kerberos ticket request.
3. If the user is missing, troubleshoot Azure AD Connect synchronization.

   **Resources**:
   - [Azure AD Connect documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/deploy/connect-install-new)

#### Step 2: Validate Kerberos Configuration
1. Verify the Key Distribution Center (KDC) settings:
   - Ensure that the KDC is accessible and configured correctly.
2. Check the Service Principal Names (SPNs):
   - Ensure that SPNs are registered correctly for the services being accessed.

   **Resources**:
   - [Kerberos authentication documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/kerberos-authentication)

#### Step 3: Network and Firewall Checks
1. Ensure that the client machine can communicate with the necessary Azure and Active Directory endpoints. 
2. Check for any firewall or network restrictions that may be blocking access.

#### Step 4: Review and Update Group Policies
1. Review group policies that may affect Kerberos authentication.
2. Test by temporarily modifying policies to allow Kerberos traffic freely.
3. Ensure all related GPOs are updated across the domain.

#### Step 5: Reissue Kerberos Ticket
1. Use the `klist purge` command to clear cached Kerberos tickets.
2. Log out and log back in to reissue a new ticket with the correct information.
  
### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure all domain controllers are healthy and synchronized.
- Make sure that Azure AD is properly configured and integrated with your on-premises Active Directory.
- Periodic reviews of the synchronized users and their respective Azure AD properties may help prevent future occurrences.

### Documentation Reference
- **Azure AD Documentation**: [Manage Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/)
- **Azure AD Connect Documentation**: [What is Azure AD Connect?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect)
- **Kerberos and Active Directory**: [Kerberos authentication overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/kerberos-authentication-overview)

### Test Documentation Reachability
- Test each link provided in the documentation references above to ensure they are accessible and provide pertinent information.

### Advice for Data Collection
- Collect logs from the affected client machine, including:
  - Azure AD sign-in logs
  - Event Viewer logs specifically related to authentication and Kerberos.
- Gather network traces if necessary using tools like Wireshark to capture Kerberos negotiation packets.
- Document all steps taken during the troubleshooting process to assist with potential escalations or future reference.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the root cause of the AADSTS81011 error effectively.

# AADSTS81011: DesktopSsoLookupUserBySidFailed - Unable to find user object based on information in the user's Kerberos ticket.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The error code **AADSTS81011** indicates a failure in the Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication process related to Kerberos ticket credential retrieval, specifically for desktop single sign-on (SSO) scenarios. Here's a detailed troubleshooting guide:

### Detailed Troubleshooting Guide

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify Environment**: Determine if the issue is occurring in a domain-joined environment where Kerberos tickets are used for authentication.
2. **Check User Account**: Verify that the user experiencing this issue is indeed a valid account in Azure AD and that they have the necessary permissions.
3. **Test Kerberos Ticket**: Use the `klist` command to check if the current user has a valid Kerberos ticket. Run `klist tgt` in a Command Prompt to see if there's a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT).
4. **Log User Activity**: Review user login or authentication attempts to see if there are multiple failed attempts logged in Azure AD or local event logs.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error
1. **Invalid Kerberos Ticket**: The Kerberos ticket may be expired, invalid, or inherently unresolvable due to incorrect configurations.
2. **User Principal Name (UPN) Mismatch**: The UPN of the user may not match the attributes in Azure AD, preventing appropriate resolution.
3. **Server Time Synchronization Issues**: Time skew between the client machine and the domain controller (DC) can lead to ticket validation failures.
4. **DNS Issues**: Client machines might be unable to resolve the DNS names of the domain or AAD endpoints necessary for authentication.
5. **Group Policy or Security Settings**: Security policies on the client machine may be preventing the successful retrieval or validation of the Kerberos ticket.

#### Step-by-step Resolution Strategies
1. **Validate Kerberos Configuration**:
   - Ensure your machine is domain-joined and that the right domain credentials have been used.
   - Run `klist` and check for the presence and validity of TGTs.

2. **Check User Account Settings**:
   - Validate that the user exists in both the on-premises Active Directory and Azure AD.
   - Ensure UPNs are correctly set up and consistent across both directories.

3. **Time Synchronization**:
   - Check the time settings on your client machine. The time should match the time on the domain controller within a 5-minute window.
   - Sync time with domain controller using `w32tm /resync`.

4. **Verify DNS Configuration**:
   - Ensure that DNS settings on the client machine point to the correct DC to resolve domain resources.
   - Run `nslookup` on your domain name to verify DNS resolution.

5. **Check for Group Policies**:
   - Review relevant Group Policies that might affect the Kerberos ticket generation. Ensure that policies allowing Kerberos authentication are not being blocked.

6. **Review and Clear Kerberos Tickets**:
   - Clear existing Kerberos tickets and obtain a new TGT using `kdestroy` followed by logging off and on again.

7. **Reboot and Retry**:
   - Sometimes, a simple reboot can resolve transient issues related to cached credentials or services.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that the Azure AD Connect service (if being used) is functioning properly in syncing users between on-premises AD and Azure AD.
- Check if the Kerberos policies on the domain controller have specific restrictions that could be affecting desktop SSO.

#### Documentation
- Microsoftâ€™s documentation on [Azure Active Directory authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios) and Kerberos authentication.
- Review [Troubleshooting Azure AD Kerberos SSO](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-kmsso-troubleshoot) for common troubleshooting steps.
- For event logging checklists, see [Diagnosing Event Logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/audit-event-logging).

#### Advice for Data Collection
1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Check relevant logs under "Windows Logs" > "Application" and "Security" for authentication errors.
   
2. **Network Traces**:
   - Capture a network trace using tools like **NetTrace** or **Fiddler** during the authentication process to analyze the traffic and look for anomalies or failures in requests to AAD.

3. **Export Logs**:
   - Export logs and traces for further analysis, especially if escalating the issue to Microsoft support.

By following this comprehensive guide, you can systematically narrow down and resolve the issue indicated by the AADSTS81011 error code.

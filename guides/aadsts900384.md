# AADSTS900384: JWT token failed signature validation. Actual message content is runtime specific, there are a variety of causes for this error. Please see the returned exception message for details.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS900384

The error code AADSTS900384 indicates that the JWT (JSON Web Token) signature validation has failed. This is often associated with authentication issues in Azure Active Directory (AAD). Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide to help diagnose and resolve the issue.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check the Exception Message**: Review the specific exception message returned alongside the AADSTS900384 code. It may provide additional context on why the signature validation failed.

2. **Identify the Environment**: Determine if the issue occurs in a development, testing, or production environment to contextualize the severity of the issue.

3. **Verify Token Structure**: Use JWT decoder tools (like jwt.io) to check the structure of the JWT token. Look for:
   - Header (Algorithm Type)
   - Payload (Claims)
   - Signature

4. **Check Token Expiration**: Ensure that the token hasn't expired. Tokens contain an `exp` claim that specifies the expiration time.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Incorrect Signing Key**: The token might be signed with a different key than what is being used for validation.

2. **Clock Skew**: If the system clocks between the token issuer and the validation service differ significantly, it can cause issues with token validity.

3. **Token Not Issued by Trusted Authority**: The token might be issued by a domain that is not recognized or trusted by your application.

4. **Malformed Token**: The structure of the JWT might be incorrect or altered.

5. **Unsupported Algorithm**: The token may be signed using an algorithm that is not supported by the receiver.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify Signing Keys**:
   - **Locate the Signing Keys**: Ensure that the correct Azure AD signing keys are being used. These keys can be found in the Azure portal under the "App registrations" section for your application.
   - **Update Keys**: If keys have been rotated, ensure your application is retrieving the latest keys.

2. **Adjust Clock Synchronization**:
   - **Check System Time**: Make sure the time on your server/machine is synchronized with a reliable time source (NTP).
   - **Implement Clock Skew Handling**: Consider allowing a small margin to account for possible time difference.

3. **Token Validation Configuration**:
   - Review the token validation settings in your application.
   - Ensure you are explicitly validating against the expected issuer and audience (`iss` and `aud` claims).

4. **Check Token Audience**:
   - Verify that the `aud` claim in the JWT matches what your application expects.

5. **Inspect the Algorithm**:
   - Confirm that the algorithm used to sign the JWT matches the algorithm defined in your application’s token validation settings. For example, if Azure AD uses RS256, ensure your app is set to expect RS256.

6. **Reissue Tokens**:
   - If the token is suspected to be malformed or expired, re-authenticate to get a new token.

7. **Use Diagnostic Tools**: If the issue persists, consider using tools such as Postman or Fiddler to manually decode and inspect the JWT tokens being sent.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Token Lifetime Management**: Configure your application to handle token expiration gracefully by implementing refresh tokens or re-authentication flows.
  
- **Security Best Practices**: Regularly review your application’s security settings and ensure you understand the implications of token handling, especially if keys are stored/managed locally.

#### Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer Logs, NetTrace, Fiddler)

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Check for authentication-related events in the Windows Event Viewer, particularly under the "Security" log.
   - Look for error messages or warnings that provide more details on the authentication process.

2. **NetTrace**:
   - Run a network trace while attempting the authentication to capture requests and responses. Tools like Wireshark can be helpful here.
   - Look for any unusual HTTP status codes or response payloads that may indicate issues.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Use Fiddler to capture and inspect HTTP traffic between your application and Azure AD.
   - Examine the request for token acquisition and the response, focusing on the headers and body of JWT tokens.

Collecting this data will provide important insights that can help identify where the authentication process may be failing.

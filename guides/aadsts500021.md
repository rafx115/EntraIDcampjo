### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS500021

### Initial Diagnostic Steps:

1. **Identify the User Account**: Determine if the account receiving the error is a guest account or a member of the tenant trying to access the resource.

2. **Confirm the Tenant Name**: Verify the tenant name mentioned in the error message and check if it's intended for access.

3. **Check User's Access Rights**: Confirm the access permissions and roles assigned to the user in the tenant they are trying to access.

4. **Examine User Attributes**: Review the user attributes for any misconfigurations regarding domain or tenant assignments.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error:

1. **Tenant Restrictions**: The tenant restriction feature is in place, limiting which tenants a user can access based on configured policies.

2. **Guest Account Limitations**: If the user account is a guest in the tenant, access might be restricted based on the configuration of how guests are managed.

3. **Incorrect Tenant ID**: The intended tenant ID might be incorrectly referenced in the access request.

4. **User Belonging to Multiple Tenants**: Users belonging to multiple tenants may run into access issues if the access attempt is to a tenant not listed in the allowed tenant configuration.

5. **Outdated Login Sessions**: Stale or expired tokens stored in local caches can also lead to access denials.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **Review Tenant Restrictions**:
   - Go to Azure AD in the Azure portal.
   - Review the settings for tenant restrictions in the “Enterprise applications” section.
   - Confirm which tenants are listed for allowed access and update accordingly if necessary.

2. **User Role Assignment**:
   - Navigate to the “Users” section in Azure AD.
   - Check the affected user’s roles and ensure that they have been granted the necessary access permissions.

3. **Verify Guest Access Settings**:
   - Check the policies governing guest access within Azure AD.
   - Navigate to “External Identities” then “External collaboration settings” to verify how guests are handled.

4. **Access Through Correct Tenant**:
   - If there’s confusion about which tenant to access, ask the user to ensure they are logging in with the correct tenant URL or confirming it explicitly with your IT team.

5. **Refresh Authentication Token**:
   - Clear any cached credentials or tokens, and prompt the user to log in again to refresh their authentication session.

### Additional Notes or Considerations:

- Ensure that any changes made in the Azure AD tenant restrictions or user permissions are followed by testing access immediately.
- It’s advisable to communicate any changes to users who might be affected.
- If your organization has multiple subscriptions or environments (e.g., dev/test/prod), make sure users are aware of which environment they should be accessing.

### Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer Logs, Network Trace, Fiddler):

1. **Event Viewer**: 
   - Check the event logs on the client device for any relevant error messages or warnings related to Azure AD authentication.

2. **Network Tracing**:
   - Use tools like `nettrace` to capture network traffic while reproducing the issue to see if there are any misdirected requests or blocked traffic.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Set up Fiddler to capture HTTP/S traffic during the login attempt to analyze the headers and payload sent in the authentication requests for any anomalies.

By following the above guidelines, you should be able to effectively troubleshoot and resolve the AADSTS500021 error.

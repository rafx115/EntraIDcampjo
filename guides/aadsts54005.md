# AADSTS54005: OAuth2 Authorization code was already redeemed, please retry with a new valid code or use an existing refresh token.


## Troubleshooting Steps
**Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS54005**

Error code AADSTS54005 indicates that the OAuth2 authorization code has already been redeemed. This typically happens in scenarios involving the OAuth2 authorization code flow used in applications for authentication.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Reproduce the Issue:**
   - Attempt to reproduce the error under the same conditions to confirm that it is consistent.
   
2. **Check Code Execution Flow:**
   - Review the application's flow to ensure that an authorization code is not being redeemed more than once.

3. **Confirm Application Settings:**
   - Verify that the application is registered correctly in Azure AD with the necessary redirect URIs.

### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **Duplicate Authorization Code Redemption:**
   - Attempting to use the same authorization code multiple times. OAuth2 authorization codes are single-use.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Tokens:**
   - Application logic does not properly manage the authorization code and access tokens.

3. **Timeout or Expiry:**
   - Authorization codes have a short lifespan and might expire before they are redeemed.

4. **Misconfigured Redirect URIs:**
   - The redirect URI in the authorization request does not match what is registered in Azure AD.

5. **Shared Authorization Code:**
   - Multiple clients (or the same client multiple times) attempting to redeem the same code.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Implement Proper Code Handling:**
   - Ensure that once an authorization code is exchanged for tokens, it’s not reused. This may involve clearing it from memory or the application state.

2. **Request a New Authorization Code:**
   - Instruct the user to start the authentication flow again to get a new authorization code.

3. **Check for Redirect URIs:**
   - Ensure that the redirect URI used in the authorization request matches the registered URI in Azure AD.

4. **Review the Token Lifecycle:**
   - Implement proper token storage and management practices, including checking token status before attempting to redeem codes.

5. **Implement Error Handling:**
   - Add error handling to manage these scenarios gracefully in your application and inform users accordingly.

6. **Configure Refresh Tokens:**
   - Use refresh tokens for long-lived sessions if appropriate for your application’s design. This avoids frequent reauthorization.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Ensure to maintain strict state management in your application, particularly in scenarios with multiple tabs or windows where the authorization flow can potentially be executed multiple times.

- Consider using libraries designed for OAuth2 (like MSAL for .NET) that properly handle the nuances of the authorization code flow.

### Documentation for Guidance

1. **Microsoft Identity Platform documentation:**
   - [Microsoft Identity Platform and OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow)
   - [Access tokens and refresh tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens)
   - [Use MSAL for secure authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview)

### Advice for Data Collection

If further investigation is needed, the following tools can assist in gathering relevant data:

1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - Review any logs related to the application's authentication processes, any failed connections, or errors logged during OAuth flows.

2. **Network Trace (NetTrace):**
   - Use NetTrace to capture packets and analyze the request/response cycle for failed token exchanges.

3. **Fiddler:**
   - Use Fiddler to inspect HTTP traffic to see details about the requests being sent, the authorization flows being employed, and responses received from Azure AD.

4. **Debug Logs:**
   - If your application supports logging, enable detailed logging for OAuth2 transactions to have a record of code requests and token handling. 

By following these strategies and utilizing the outlined tools, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve the AADSTS54005 error in your application.

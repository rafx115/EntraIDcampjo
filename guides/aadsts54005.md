# AADSTS54005: OAuth2 Authorization code was already redeemed, please retry with a new valid code or use an existing refresh token.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Error Code: AADSTS54005 - OAuth2 Authorization Code Already Redeemed

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Check Request Flow**: Review the authentication flow to identify where the authorization code is being exchanged.
2. **Verify Authorization Code**: Confirm if the authorization code being used is a valid one.
3. **Check Refresh Token**: If applicable, check if a refresh token is being used or is available.

#### Common Issues Causing the Error:
1. **Reusing Authorization Code**: Attempting to redeem an authorization code multiple times.
2. **Expired Authorization Code**: Trying to use an authorization code after its validity period has elapsed.
3. **Invalid Refresh Token**: If using a refresh token, ensure it is valid and has not expired.
4. **Concurrency Issue**: If multiple requests are made simultaneously using the same authorization code.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Generate a New Authorization Code**:
   - If the error suggests using a new valid code, start by generating a fresh authorization code.
  
2. **Use an Existing Refresh Token**:
   - If you have a refresh token available, consider using it to obtain a new access token instead of the authorization code.
  
3. **Check Token Validity**:
   - Verify the validity of the tokens being used, ensuring they are not expired.
  
4. **Log out and Log In**:
   - Log out of the application or service, then log back in and attempt the authentication process again.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- It's crucial to handle authorization codes securely to prevent unauthorized access.
- If using a refresh token, ensure it is properly managed and securely stored.
- Review the implementation of token redemption logic to avoid potential race conditions.

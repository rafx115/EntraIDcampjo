## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS135010 "KeyNotFound" Error

The AADSTS135010 error, with the description "KeyNotFound", is typically found in the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) context, especially during authentication scenarios. This error generally indicates that a required key or configuration for authentication could not be found. Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide to help you identify and resolve the issue.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check Error Context**: Identify where the error occurred:
   - Is it during a user login?
   - Is it happening during API calls or service principal operations?

2. **Review Authentication Logs**:
   - Use Azure AD logs to check for any related errors.
   - Verify if there are any patterns or specific users who are facing issues.

3. **Reproduce the Issue**: Try to reproduce the error under controlled conditions to understand how it manifests.

#### Common Issues that Cause this Error

1. **Missing or Deleted Keys/Certificates**:
   - The public key or certificate required for signing the token is missing from Azure AD.

2. **Credential Configuration Issues**:
   - Misconfiguration of application secrets or certificates can prevent successful authentication.

3. **Changes to Application Registrations**:
   - If the application registration was recently modified, essential keys may have been removed or altered.

4. **Environment Issues**:
   - Issues with the environment (development, production) where configurations differ.

5. **Scope and Permissions**: 
   - The scopes or permissions requested might not be correctly configured.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify Application Registration**:
   - Go to the Azure Portal -> Azure Active Directory -> App Registrations.
   - Check that the application is correctly configured and registered.
   - Look under "Certificates & secrets" to ensure the required keys are present.

2. **Check Sign-in Settings**:
   - Verify the "Authentication" settings of the app registration.
   - Ensure that the redirect URIs and logout URLs are correctly configured.

3. **Key Vault Integration**:
   - If using Azure Key Vault for managing keys, check that keys are available and not expired.
   - Ensure that your application has proper access to the Key Vault.

4. **Application Permissions**:
   - Confirm that the correct permissions are set for the API your application is trying to access.
   - Check if admin consent is required and has been granted.

5. **Testing with Different Environments**:
   - If possible, test the application in different environments (development/test) and check if the error persists across environments.

6. **Reset Client Secrets**:
   - If using client secrets, consider regenerating them and updating your application configuration.

7. **Utilize Azure AD Token Validation**:
   - Use tools like jwt.ms or Postman to validate the extracted token and check its claims for issues.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Ensure that any changes to configurations or key updates are mirrored across all environments.
- Regularly review and audit key and certificate usage to ensure they are up-to-date and valid.
- Be aware of the size and content of the token, especially if using custom claims.

#### Advice for Data Collection

When diagnosing issues like AADSTS135010, collect the following data:

1. **Event Viewer Logs**: 
   - Check the Windows Event Viewer, focusing on the Application and Security logs for related errors.

2. **Network Traces**:
   - Use tools like `NetTrace` to capture traffic and check for issues related to authentication endpoints.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - If applicable, capture HTTP requests/responses using Fiddler to analyze the authentication flow and observe if there are any discrepancies.

4. **Azure AD Logs**:
   - Review Azure AD audit logs for related events, focusing on login attempts and errors.

By following this guide, you should be able to troubleshoot and resolve the AADSTS135010 "KeyNotFound" error effectively. If the error persists after these steps, consider reaching out to Microsoft support for further analysis.

## Troubleshooting Steps
### Error Code: AADSTS135010 - KeyNotFound

### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. Verify the specific context in which the error occurred (e.g., application login, user authentication).
2. Check if the error is consistent across different users or only specific users.
3. Review recent changes made to the Azure Active Directory (AAD) configuration.

### Common Issues:
- Incorrect configuration of application settings in Azure AD.
- Misconfiguration of keys or certificates related to the application.
- Expired or revoked keys/certificates causing authentication failures.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Verify Application Configuration**:
   - Check the application registration in Azure AD portal for any missing or incorrect settings.
   - Ensure that the correct client ID, tenant ID, redirect URIs, and other application-specific settings are configured.

2. **Check Keys and Certificates**:
   - Navigate to the application's platform settings in Azure AD and validate that the keys or certificates used for authentication are current and correctly configured.
   - If needed, generate new keys or certificates and update the application configuration accordingly.

3. **Verify Permissions**:
   - Ensure that the application has the necessary permissions and roles assigned in Azure AD to perform the required actions.
   - Check if the user attempting to authenticate has the right permissions to access the application.

4. **Token Validation**:
   - Validate the tokens issued by Azure AD during the authentication process to ensure they are correctly signed and not tampered with.

5. **Monitor Logs and Audit Trails**:
   - Review Azure AD logs and audit trails to identify any specific errors or events that might be related to the KeyNotFound issue.

### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- If the issue persists after verifying the above steps, consider reaching out to Microsoft Azure support for further assistance.

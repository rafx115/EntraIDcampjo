# AADSTS900971: No reply address provided.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The error code AADSTS900971, with the description "No reply address provided," indicates that an application attempting to use Azure Active Directory (AAD) for authentication did not supply a valid redirect URI (or reply address) when making the authentication request. Here's a detailed troubleshooting guide to resolve this issue.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Read the Full Error Message**: Ensure you capture the entire context in which the error occurs, including the application or system making the request.
   
2. **Check the Application Registration in Azure**: 
    - Navigate to the Azure portal.
    - Go to "Azure Active Directory" > "App registrations" and select the application.
    - Verify that the "Redirect URIs" are correctly defined.

3. **Review the Request Parameters**:
    - If you have access to the application code, log or inspect the authentication request to ensure it includes a `redirect_uri` parameter.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **Missing Redirect URI**: The application did not send any redirect URI in the authentication request.
2. **Incorrect Redirect URI**: The redirect URI does not match any of the registered redirect URIs in the Azure app registration.
3. **Protocol Issues**: The scheme (http vs https) does not match between what is registered and what is sent.
4. **Application Type Differences**: You may be using a different application type (web, native, etc.) that requires different handling of redirect URIs.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Add or Correct Redirect URI**:
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to your app registration.
   - Under "Authentication," ensure that a valid redirect URI is listed.
   - Add any missing redirect URIs that your application is supposed to handle.

2. **Verify Request Parameters**:
   - Inspect the code that makes the authentication request.
   - Ensure that it includes the `redirect_uri` parameter in the request.
   - Example parameter: `redirect_uri=https://yourapp.com/auth/callback`.

3. **Check Application Registration Type**:
   - Determine if the application is configured correctly based on its type (web, public client, single-page app).
   - For web applications, ensure that `Allow public client flows` is set correctly as needed.

4. **Use the Correct Protocol**:
   - Make sure that the `redirect_uri` uses the correct protocol (http or https) and exactly matches one of the registered URIs.

5. **Re-test the Authentication Flow**:
   - After making the necessary changes, test the authentication flow again to see if the issue is resolved.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Multi-Tenant Applications**: If the application is multi-tenant, ensure the appropriate settings are configured for all tenants.
- **User Domain**: Make sure that your app is allowed to authenticate users from the domain in question, if applicable.
- **State Parameter**: If using the OAuth state parameter, ensure itâ€™s being passed correctly as well.

### Documentation for Guidance
- [Azure AD App Registration Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)
- [Redirect URIs for Azure Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-app-redirect-uri)
- [Authentication Libraries for Azure AD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-authentication-libraries)

### Advice for Data Collection
If the problem persists, you may need to collect further diagnostic logs:

1. **Event Viewer**: Check the application and system logs in the Event Viewer for any Azure AD-related errors.
2. **NetTrace**: Use .NET tracing to capture activity related to authentication that may provide further insight.
3. **Fiddler**: A Fiddler trace can capture HTTP requests that show the exact parameters being sent in the authentication request. 

   - **Fiddler Setup**:
     - Start Fiddler and enable capture.
     - Perform the authentication operation to reproduce the error.
     - Look for requests to the Azure AD authentication endpoint and inspect the request parameters.

Collecting this data can help in diagnosing subtle issues, such as incorrect payload structures or hidden errors in the request flow. 

### Summary
Following the steps outlined above should help in diagnosing and fixing the AADSTS900971 error. Always make sure to review the current application settings in Azure AD meticulously, as slight mismatches can result in issues during authentication.

# AADSTS900971: No reply address provided.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS900971: No Reply Address Provided

#### Error Description:
The error code AADSTS900971 indicates that the application tried to sign in to Azure Active Directory (AAD) but did not provide a reply address in the authentication request. The reply address, also known as the redirect URI, is crucial for redirecting users back to your application after authentication.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify the Application:**
   - Determine which application is attempting to authenticate when this error occurs.
   
2. **Check the Authentication Flow:**
   - Review the type of authentication flow being used, whether it's OAuth2, OpenID Connect, etc.

3. **Review the Error Message:**
   - Check the full error message context if available, to understand where the error is originating from (browser, service, etc.).

4. **Inspect URL Parameters:**
   - If possible, examine the URL that triggered this error to see if the redirect URI is included and correctly formatted.

### Common Issues that Cause this Error

1. **Missing Redirect URI:**
   - The most common cause is that the redirect URI is not specified in the authentication request.

2. **Malformed Request:**
   - If the request is incorrect or malformed, it might not include required parameters like the redirect URI.

3. **Application Registration Mismatch:**
   - The registered redirect URIs in the Azure portal may not match those used in your application code. 

4. **Postman or Development Environment Issues:**
   - If you are testing using tools like Postman, ensure the requests are correctly formed.

5. **Configuration Issues:**
   - Issues in Azure AD app registration could lead to missing or incorrect configuration causing this error.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Provide the Redirect URI:**
   - Ensure that the authentication request in your application includes a redirect URI. Here’s how you can do that:

   **Example Request:**
   ```plaintext
   GET https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?
     client_id={client_id}
     &response_type=code
     &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fcallback
     &scope=user.read
   ```

2. **Register Redirect URIs in Azure AD:**
   - Go to the Azure portal: [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
     - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory -> App registrations**.
     - Select your application.
     - In the **Authentication** section, under **Redirect URIs**, ensure the URI is listed and matches the one used in your requests. If this URI is absent, add it and save.

3. **Test Redirect URI:**
   - Ensure the redirect URI is reachable and correctly implemented in your application code. 

4. **Check for URL Encoding:**
   - Ensure the redirect URI is properly URL-encoded when included in requests. Use tools or libraries to help with URL encoding.

5. **Review Application Permissions:**
   - Verify the application registration permissions; sometimes, required permissions may interfere with various flows.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **CORS Configuration:** If your application requires a front-end that operates on a different origin than the API, make sure CORS settings accommodate that.
- **Environment-Specific Behavior:** Ensure to check if this issue is happening in specific environments (e.g., development vs. production).
- **Multiple Redirect URIs:** If your application uses multiple environments (e.g., dev, QA, prod), ensure that each environment's redirect URI is properly registered.

### Advice for Data Collection

- Monitor logs in your application to capture relevant request details when the error occurs.
- Check the network requests in your application using developer tools in your browser.
- Gather specifics about the authentication flow (e.g., OAuth2, OpenID) being used when reproducing the error.
- Note any error messages or stack traces that accompany the AADSTS900971 error, as they may lend further insight into the underlying issue.

# AADSTS50003: MissingSigningKey - Sign-in failed because of a missing signing key or certificate. This might be because there was no signing key configured in the app. To learn more, see the troubleshooting article for errorAADSTS50003. If you still see issues, contact the app owner or an app admin.


## Troubleshooting Steps
## Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS50003

The Azure Active Directory error code AADSTS50003 indicates that a sign-in attempt failed due to a "MissingSigningKey." Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide to help diagnose and resolve this issue.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Verify the Signs of the Error**: 
   - Confirm that the user encounters the AADSTS50003 error when attempting to sign in to the application.
   - Note any specific circumstances or configurations that could be relevant, such as recent changes to the application.

2. **Check User Information**: 
   - Determine if the error is occurring for multiple users or only specific ones. This could help identify if the issue is user-specific or application-wide.

3. **Review Application Registration in Azure**: 
   - Go to the Azure portal and navigate to the App registrations section. Verify the application's settings and configurations.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Missing or Incorrect Signing Keys**: 
   - The application may not be configured with the appropriate signing keys or certificates, which are necessary for authenticating tokens.

2. **Expired or Invalid Certificates**: 
   - If the application uses certificates for signing, an expired or invalid certificate can lead to this error.

3. **Changes in Key Configuration**: 
   - Recent updates to the app's registration settings might have inadvertently removed or altered signing keys or certificates.

4. **Service Principal Misconfigurations**: 
   - Issues with the service principal associated with the application may lead to authentication problems.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Check the Application's Signing Key or Certificate**:
   - Navigate to the Azure portal, go to "Azure Active Directory" > "App registrations" > [Your Application].
   - Under "Certificates & secrets", check if there are valid signing certificates or secrets. If missing, generate a new certificate or secret.

2. **Validate Existing Keys**:
   - Ensure that existing certificates are valid and not expired. If expired, upload a new certificate.

3. **Ensure the Correct Key is Being Used**:
   - In your application code, ensure that the appropriate key or certificate is being referenced for token signing and validation.

4. **Test Application Registration Configuration**:
   - Confirm that the redirect URIs, scopes, and permissions are set correctly. Any misconfiguration can affect how the app acquires tokens.

5. **Check Permissions**:
   - Ensure the app has the necessary permissions to authenticate users and access required resources.

6. **Re-register the Application** (if needed):
   - If issues persist, consider re-registering the application in Azure Active Directory to refresh the configuration.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Be cautious when handling certificates; ensure they are stored securely and permissions are managed properly.
- Review Azure's role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure appropriate access for administrators and users.
- If the application uses a custom signed token, double-check that the signing policy and key match those used in the application.

### Advice for Data Collection for Diagnostics

To help diagnose the problem, you can collect the following data:

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Check the application logs in the Windows Event Viewer under "Applications and Services Logs" > "Microsoft" > "Windows" > "AzureAD".

2. **NetTrace**:
   - Utilize the Microsoft Network Monitor (NetMon) to capture network traces. This can help identify issues with network requests related to authentication.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Use Fiddler to inspect HTTP requests and responses. Review what tokens are being sent and what responses are received during the sign-in process.
   - Look specifically for responses from Azure AD that might provide insights into the error encountered.

### Conclusion

By following the troubleshooting guide above, you can systematically identify and resolve the AADSTS50003 error related to missing signing keys or certificates. Always ensure to work in a secure environment, especially when handling keys and tokens. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Microsoft support for further assistance.

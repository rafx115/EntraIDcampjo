## Troubleshooting Steps
### Error Code: AADSTS7000222 - InvalidClientSecretExpiredKeysProvided

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Verify Client Secret Expiry**: Check if the client secret keys used by your application have expired.
2. **Confirm Client Credentials**: Ensure that the client secret keys provided match the ones registered for your app on the Azure portal.
3. **Review Azure AD Configuration**: Validate the configuration settings for your app in Azure Active Directory.

#### Common Issues:
- **Expired Client Secret Keys**: The primary cause of this error is using expired client secret keys.
- **Misconfigured Client Secrets**: If the client secret keys have been updated on the Azure portal but not in the application code, it can lead to this issue.
- **Invalid Application Registration**: If the app registration in Azure AD is not properly configured, it can cause authentication failures.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Generate New Client Secret Keys**:
   - Navigate to the Azure portal and update the client secret keys for your application.
   - Securely store the new keys and update them in your application code.

2. **Switch to Using Certificate Credentials**:
   - Consider using certificate credentials for increased security. This involves creating and registering a certificate for your application in Azure AD.

3. **Update Application Configuration**:
   - Modify the application code to use the new client secret keys or certificate credentials.
   - Ensure that the client secret keys are not hard-coded and are securely managed.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- Client secret keys should be rotated periodically for security best practices.
- Regularly review and update the configuration settings for your application in Azure AD.

## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS7000222

**Error Description**: `InvalidClientSecretExpiredKeysProvided - The provided client secret keys are expired. Create new keys for your app, or consider using certificate credentials for added security: https://aka.ms/certCreds`

This error indicates that the client secret keys used for authenticating against Azure Active Directory (AAD) are no longer valid because they have expired. 

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify the Application**: Determine which application is presenting this error. This might be a web app, a mobile app, or a service.
2. **Check the AAD Application Registration**: Go to the Azure portal and navigate to the registered application that corresponds to the client secret being used.
3. **Identify the Authentication Method Used**: Confirm if the application is using client secrets or certificates for authentication.
4. **Examine the Error Message Context**: Look at logs or error messages for the client application to provide context on the failure.

#### Common Issues that Cause this Error
1. **Expired Client Secret**: The most common cause is that the client secret has exceeded its expiration date.
2. **Limited Secret Lifetime**: If the application was registered with a short lifespan for client secrets (e.g., months rather than years).
3. **Incorrect Client Secret**: Ensure that the correct client secret value is being used in the application; an old or wrong value could also raise this error.
4. **Misconfigured App Permissions**: Check if the application permissions have changed, including scopes that may require a refreshed secret.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Generate a New Client Secret**:
   - Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations**.
   - Select the application experiencing the issue.
   - Click on **Certificates & secrets** in the left navigation pane.
   - Click on **New client secret**, provide a description, select an expiration period, and click **Add**.
   - **Important**: Copy the new secret value immediately, as it will not be visible again.

2. **Update Application Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the application is updated to use the new client secret. This may involve updating configuration files, environment variables, or secure stores where the secret is stored.
   - If using a configuration file (e.g., `appsettings.json`), locate the old secret and replace it with the new one.

3. **Test the Application**:
   - Restart the application if necessary.
   - Test the functionality that was previously producing the error to verify that the new secret resolves the issue.

4. **Consider Using Certificate Credentials** (Optional):
   - For improved security, consider switching from client secrets to certificate-based authentication.
   - Follow the [Microsoft documentation on using certificates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-authentication-certificates) for guidance on setting this up.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Expiration Policy**: Regularly check and maintain client secrets to prevent future issues. Set reminders for secret renewals.
- **Security Best Practices**: Avoid hardcoding secrets within the application code. Use secure storage solutions, such as Azure Key Vault.
- **Documentation for Guidance**: 
  - [Managing Client Secrets in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v2-nodejs-webapp)
  - [Use certificates to authenticate apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-authentication-certificates)

#### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**: Check the Event Viewer for any application-specific logs that might provide detailed error context.
- **Network Traces**:
  - **NetTrace**: Use this for capturing network traffic to observe requests and responses related to AAD authentication.
  - **Fiddler**: Configure Fiddler to capture HTTP(S) traffic and look for responses from AAD that indicate what may be wrong with the client secret.

By following this guide, you should be able to address error code AADSTS7000222 effectively. Ensure to update any processes for managing client secrets and periodically review app registrations to enhance security and reliability.

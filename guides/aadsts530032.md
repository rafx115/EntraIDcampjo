# AADSTS530032: BlockedByConditionalAccessOnSecurityPolicy - The tenant admin has configured a security policy that blocks this request. Check the security policies that are defined on the tenant level to determine if your request meets the policy requirements.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The error code AADSTS530032 indicates that a security policy has been set by the tenant admin that blocks the request due to Conditional Access policies or other configured security measures in Azure Active Directory (AAD). Below is a comprehensive troubleshooting guide to help diagnose and resolve this issue.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS530032

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Confirm the Error**: Ensure that the error AADSTS530032 is indeed what you are encountering. Note the context in which the error occurs (e.g., during login, accessing an application, etc.).

2. **Gather User Information**: Collect relevant details regarding the affected user:
   - User account and roles.
   - Location from which the user is trying to access resources.
   - Type of device (managed, unmanaged).
   - Application being accessed.

3. **Check Tenant Admin Notifications**: Look for any communications from the tenant admin to users about changes in security policies or access restrictions.

4. **Use Azure Active Directory Sign-in Logs**: Check the Azure portal for Sign-in logs to get more context about the failed sign-in attempt. Access it through:
   - Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > Sign-ins.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error
1. **Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Policies may require multi-factor authentication (MFA) that the user does not meet.
   - Policies requiring the user to be on a specific network (e.g., corporate VPN) and the user is not connected.
   - Device compliance checks failing (e.g., the device is not enrolled in Intune or does not meet security standards).

2. **User License and Role Issues**: The user's role may lack the necessary permissions to access certain resources, or their license may not grant required rights.

3. **Identity Protection Policies**: Security features like risk-based conditional access can block users flagged for risky behaviors.

4. **System Updates or Changes**: Recent updates to applications or system environments can inadvertently affect access policies.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Review Conditional Access Policies**:
   - As an admin, visit Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > Security > Conditional Access.
   - Review active policies for any that affect the user, especially policies around MFA, location, and device compliance.

2. **Adjust or Disable Policies Temporarily**:
   - If it's appropriate, consider adjusting the policies to exclude the affected user or testing access with the policies disabled (ensure to document changes and revert after testing).

3. **Ensure User Meets Access Requirements**:
   - Verify that the user has a compliant device if the policy enforces device compliance.
   - If MFA is required, ensure the user has set it up correctly.

4. **Check User's Role and License**:
   - Verify that the user has the necessary licenses assigned in Azure Active Directory.
   - Check that they have the appropriate roles assigned to access the application or resources.

5. **Audit and Revise Configuration Settings**:
   - Verify any recent changes to security policy settings or AAD configurations.
   - Collaborate with the IT or security team to rethink security policies if necessary.

6. **Test with a Different User or Device**:
   - If possible, try replicating the issue with another user account or device to rule out user-specific or device-specific configurations.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that you follow your organization's change management policy when making adjustments to security settings.
- Pay attention to the published documentation by Microsoft, as Conditional Access policies and other configurations can change over time.

#### Documentation for Guidance
- Official Microsoft Documentation for [Conditional Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/conditional-access-overview)
- [Troubleshoot sign-in issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/user-help/how-to-troubleshoot-signin-issues)
- [Sign-in logs in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins)

#### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**: On the affected device, check the Event Viewer under Windows Logs > Application and System logs for any relevant entries during authentication attempts.
  
- **Network Traces**: Use tools like `netsh trace start` for obtaining network traces or Fiddler to capture detailed HTTP requests and responses related to the failed authentication request.

- **Fiddler**: If using Fiddler, set it up to capture HTTPS traffic which may show HTTP status codes, redirect issues, and detailed error messages that accompany AAD errors.

By following this guide, you should be able to pinpoint the cause of the AADSTS530032 error and take the appropriate steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue effectively.

# AADSTS70019: CodeExpired - Verification code expired. Have the user retry the sign-in.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS70019 - CodeExpired

**Description**: `AADSTS70019 - CodeExpired` indicates that the verification code issued for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or other verification mechanisms has expired. Users need to retry the sign-in process to receive a new verification code.

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify the Context**: 
   - Determine when and where the error occurred. 
   - Check if the user was attempting to sign in for the first time or after multiple unsuccessful attempts.

2. **Verify Time Setting on Devices**:
   - Ensure that the system time on the user's device and the server time are synchronized. Incorrect time settings may lead to code expiration issues.

3. **Check User Details**:
   - Confirm the user’s account status (active, locked, or disabled) in Azure Active Directory (AAD).

### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Expired Verification Code**: 
   - The verification code has a specific validity period (typically 30 days) and must be used promptly.

2. **Time Synchronization Issues**: 
   - Discrepancies in time between the server and user devices can lead to validation failures of the verification code.

3. **Network Connectivity Problems**: 
   - Poor connectivity can delay the authentication process, leading to expired codes.

4. **User Action Delays**: 
   - Users taking too long to enter their verification code after receiving it.

5. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Attempting to request multiple verification codes in a short period may temporarily block new requests.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **User Retry**:
   - Ask the user to attempt to sign in again. A new verification code will be issued.

2. **Time Check**:
   - Ensure the user’s device has the correct time:
     - For Windows: Right-click the time on the taskbar > Adjust date/time > Ensure automatic time set is enabled.
     - For macOS: System Preferences > Date & Time > Set date and time automatically.

3. **Network Connectivity**:
   - Confirm the device has a stable internet connection. Have the user test navigation to other websites or perform a speed test.

4. **Reinitialize Sign-In**:
   - Direct the user to completely log out of the account and retry signing in.
   - Clear the browser cache or use an incognito window to eliminate caching issues.

5. **Account Status Check**:
   - If the problem persists, check the Azure AD portal for the user's account status.
     - Navigate to Azure Active Directory > Users > [User Name] and verify the status.

6. **Account Activity**:
   - If the user has exceeded the rate limit for authentication requests, advise a short waiting period before retrying.

7. **Security Settings**:
   - Check if any policies (e.g., Conditional Access) are affecting MFA requirements.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Code Lifetime**: Inform users about the expected time they have to use the verification code before it expires.
- **Educate Users**: Provide basic training on how MFA works to reduce frustration and improve user experience.
- **Organizational Policies**: Review current organizational security policies regarding MFA and code expiration to align with user needs.

### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Gather User Feedback**: 
   - Ask the user to provide details about the context of the error, including the steps leading to it.

2. **Log Errors**:
   - Keep logs of error occurrences from the user’s activity, noting timestamps and any relevant system messages.

3. **Monitor Patterns**:
   - Identify if there are any patterns where this error commonly occurs (specific devices, times of the day, etc.)

4. **Collect Time Sync Information**:
   - Record time settings from the user's device and server to support troubleshooting.

5. **Capture Account Status**:
   - Document the status of the user’s account in Azure AD at the time of failure.

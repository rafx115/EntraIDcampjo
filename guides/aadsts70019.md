# AADSTS70019: CodeExpired - Verification code expired. Have the user retry the sign-in.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS70019: CodeExpired

The error code AADSTS70019 indicates that the verification code used for authentication has expired. This happens often in situations where users receive a time-sensitive code (e.g., through email or SMS) and do not use it within the specified time frame.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Verify User Credentials:** Ensure that the user is attempting to log in with the correct username and password.
2. **Check Time Synchronization:** Confirm that the user's device clock is set to the correct time. Time discrepancies can affect code validity.
3. **Identify the Environment:** Determine whether the user is attempting to access a mobile app, web portal, or another application using Azure AD authentication.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **Expired Verification Code:** Users did not enter the code in time before it expired.
2. **Clock Settings:** The device's time settings may be incorrect, leading to a perceived expiration of the verification code.
3. **Network Latency:** Slow network connections can delay the receipt and processing of verification codes.
4. **Multiple Requests:** The user could have requested multiple verification codes, leading to confusion about which code to use.
5. **User Frustration:** Users may repeatedly try to log in, causing repeated expirations of the code.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **User Education:**
   - Inform users about the importance of entering the verification code promptly after receipt.
   - Advise them on the duration of code validity (typically a few minutes but confirm based on your specific authentication settings).

2. **Request a New Code:**
   - Ask the user to initiate a new sign-in attempt and request a fresh verification code.
   - Ensure that they use this code promptly.

3. **Check Device Settings:**
   - Ensure the userâ€™s device has the correct time zone and is synchronized with an internet time server.
   - Advise users to adjust their device settings if there are any discrepancies.

4. **Examine Network Conditions:**
   - Check for any intermittent network issues that may delay the receipt of the verification code or slow down the authentication process.
   - If applicable, test logins in different network environments (e.g., Wi-Fi vs. mobile data).

5. **Account and Application State:**
   - Verify whether the user's account status in the Azure Active Directory is active and that there are no policies or conditions affecting their login.
   - Ensure that the application they're trying to access is correctly configured with Azure AD and that all permissions are granted.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- If users frequently encounter this issue, investigate whether there are underlying problems with the service or application performing the authentication. Look for updates or changes in code delivery mechanisms, like additional security measures being applied.
- Monitor user feedback to determine if this is a widespread issue affecting many users, which may indicate an issue with the Azure AD setup.

#### Advice for Data Collection

In the event that troubleshooting doesn't resolve the issue:

1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - Check the Windows Event Viewer on the client machine for any messages related to sign-in attempts that could provide more context on the failure.
   - Focus on logs under Windows Logs > Application and System.

2. **Fiddler or Network Tracing:**
   - Use Fiddler to capture HTTP requests if the issue occurs during web authentication. Look for any 4xx or 5xx error responses.
   - Analyze the request/response for clues about the failure.

3. **NetTrace:**
   - Capture a network trace to cross-reference the authentication request and response, especially useful for applications making direct calls to Azure AD.
   - This requires technical knowledge on how to use tools like Microsoft Message Analyzer or Wireshark.

By following this comprehensive troubleshooting guide, you should be able to identify and address the AADSTS70019 error effectively.

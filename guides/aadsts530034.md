# AADSTS530034: DelegatedAdminBlockedDueToSuspiciousActivity - A delegated administrator was blocked from accessing the tenant due to account risk in their home tenant.


## Troubleshooting Steps
The AADSTS530034 error means that a delegated administrator is blocked from accessing a tenant due to suspected suspicious activity related to their home tenant. This can occur for various reasons related to the security posture of the administrator's account and may require coordination between different tenants.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS530034

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Error Identification**:
   - Confirm the exact error code and description returned during the login attempt.
   - Ensure the user attempting to log in is indeed a delegated administrator.

2. **Check Account Status**:
   - Verify if the delegated administrator's account is still active and not disabled, locked, or subject to any conditional access policies.

3. **Review Tenant Activity**:
   - Check the activity log for any suspicious sign-in attempts or other security alerts related to the administratorâ€™s home tenant.

4. **Identify Home Tenant**:
   - Determine which Azure AD tenant the user is a delegated administrator for, as this might help in contacting the right support resources.

5. **Examine MFA Status**:
   - Ensure multi-factor authentication (MFA) is set up for the delegated administrator account. Suspicious activities might trigger an MFA requirement.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Suspicious Sign-ins**: 
   - The delegated administrator's home tenant may have detected unusual sign-in patterns that triggered a security block.

2. **Blocked via Conditional Access**:
   - The home tenant may block the administrator based on its conditional access policies due to security concerns.

3. **User Account Risk**: 
   - If the home tenant's security measures classify the delegated administrator's account as high-risk, it could lead to a block.

4. **User License Issues**:
   - There may be issues with the licenses assigned to the delegated administrator's account, particularly if they impact access rights.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify User Account Health**:
   - **Step 1**: Log into the home tenant's Azure AD portal.
   - **Step 2**: Navigate to 'Users' and select the affected delegated administrator.
   - **Step 3**: Check the sign-in status and confirm if the account shows any risk alerts.

2. **Review Security Alerts**:
   - **Step 1**: In the home tenant, go to the 'Azure Active Directory' -> 'Security' -> 'Sign-ins.'
   - **Step 2**: Look for any alerts or incidents that may help identify suspicious activities linked to the account.

3. **Contact Support**:
   - If it's determined that blocks are due to account risk settings, the tenant admin of the home tenant must contact Microsoft Support for assistance in assessing the situation and potentially unblocking the account.

4. **Update Security Settings**:
   - **Step 1**: Ensure MFA is enforced for the delegated admin.
   - **Step 2**: Educate the user on security best practices.
   - **Step 3**: Consider configuring conditional access policies that allow more secure access if necessary.

5. **Document Events**:
   - Collect event logs and any relevant data that could help in troubleshooting. This should be done for both the tenant with access issues and the home tenant.
   - Utilize tools like the Azure AD audit logs or sign-in logs for more information on the user's sign-in attempts.

6. **Resend Access Permissions**:
   - If the issue is resolved and access is reinstated, consider re-issuing or verifying the delegated admin permissions to ensure they are correctly set.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Regularly review the security health of accounts, particularly for delegated administrators who have broader access.
- Consider implementing dynamic risk assessment tools available in Azure AD Premium for monitoring unusual activity.
- Ensure robust logging mechanisms are in place so that any issues can be promptly addressed in the future.

### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Collect logs about user authentication events specific to the application in use.
   - Look for entries related to the delegated administrator's sign-in attempts.

2. **Using Nettrace**:
   - Capture network traffic when attempting to log in to identify failed requests or erroneous status codes.

3. **Using Fiddler**:
   - Fiddler can help to inspect HTTP requests while the sign-in is occurring. Analyze any response codes that could indicate why access is blocked.

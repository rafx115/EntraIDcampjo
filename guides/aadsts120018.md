## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The error code AADSTS120018 with the description "PasswordChangePasswordDoesnotComplyFuzzyPolicy" typically indicates an issue where the user's password change does not comply with the policy set by Azure Active Directory. Here is a detailed troubleshooting guide to help you resolve this error:

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:**
1. **Confirm the Error:** Make sure you are seeing the error code AADSTS120018 and the description "PasswordChangePasswordDoesnotComplyFuzzyPolicy."
2. **Check Password Policy:** Understand the password policy requirements and constraints set by Azure Active Directory.

**Common Issues that Cause this Error:**
1. **Password Complexity:** The new password may not meet the complexity requirements (e.g., length, complexity, history restrictions) defined in the Azure Active Directory policy.
2. **Password Expiration:** The password change attempt may be violating the password expiration policy.
3. **Password Strength:** The new password may be too weak or easily guessable, leading to the error.
4. **Password History:** The new password may be similar to the previous passwords used by the user, violating the password history policy.
5. **MFA Requirements:** Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) might be required but not properly set up or verified during the password change process.

**Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:**
1. **Review Password Policy:** Understand the password policy requirements specific to your Azure Active Directory setup.
2. **Choose Strong Password:** Make sure the new password is strong, unique, and complies with the password policy (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements).
3. **Avoid Common Patterns:** Avoid using easily guessable passwords or variations of old passwords.
4. **Verify MFA:** If Multi-Factor Authentication is enabled, ensure it is configured correctly and verify during the password change process.
5. **Reset Password:** If needed, reset the user's password using Azure Active Directory admin center or PowerShell with a compliant password.

**Additional Notes or Considerations:**
- **User Communication:** Inform users about password policy requirements to avoid future issues.

## Troubleshooting Steps
## Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS120018: "PasswordChangePasswordDoesnotComplyFuzzyPolicy"

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Understand the Error Code**: The AADSTS120018 error indicates that the user's attempted password change does not meet the fuzzy policy requirements set by the organization. The fuzzy policy is a set of rules that aims to ensure password complexity and uniqueness.

2. **Identify the Context**: Determine where the error occurred:
   - Was it during a password change via Azure AD portal, Office 365, a custom application, or another service?
   - Are there specific guidelines or policies communicated by your organization regarding password complexity?

3. **Gather User Information**: Collect the user details associated with the password change request:
   - User ID or email
   - Previous password and the attempted new password (if appropriate)
   - Time of the attempt

### Common Issues That Cause This Error
- The new password does not meet complexity requirements (e.g., length, character types).
- The new password is too similar to previous passwords (based on the fuzzy policy).
- User account may be subject to specific organizational restrictions that override standard password policies.
- The user may have reset their password too frequently, leading to proximity issues with recently used passwords.
- Default password policies when the organization's policy is not properly configured.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Review Password Policy**:
   - Check Azure AD password policies that may be attached to the user.
   - Common requirements may include:
     - Minimum password length (typically 8 characters)
     - Inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters
     - Numbers and special characters
     - No resemblance to previous passwords

2. **Educate Users on Password Creation**:
   - Provide guidance to users on creating strong passwords that meet the complexity requirements.
   - Encourage the use of passphrases or memorable yet complex combinations of characters.

3. **Use Azure AD Portal**:
   - Instruct users to log in to the Azure AD portal to change their password.
   - Ensure they are following their organization's specific guidelines when creating a new password.

4. **Test Alternate Passwords**:
   - If the password change fails, have the user test applying different combinations of characters while adhering to complexity rules.
   - Note to avoid previously used passwords that closely resemble the failed password attempt.

5. **Enforcement of Policies**:
   - If the organizational password policy is outdated, consider updating it through Azure AD admin settings.
   - Use Microsoft Azure AD PowerShell to retrieve and adjust the password policies if necessary.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **User Education**: Regularly educate users about password security essentials and updates in policy to minimize the number of failed attempts.
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Avoid any unauthorized verification or logging of user passwords in diagnostics.
- **Cookie Policy**: Ensure that if using a web application, session cookies and relevant tokens are handled appropriately.

### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**: Collect relevant authentication failure logs from the Windows Event Viewer. Check under `Applications and Services Logs` for Azure Active Directory logs.
- **Network Monitoring Tools**: Utilize tools like `NetTrace` or `Fiddler` to capture HTTP requests and responses during the password change process to identify any possible discrepancies or errors.
- **Activity Reports in Azure**: Use Azure ADâ€™s sign-ins or audit logs to identify additional issues related to the user's account.

By following these guidelines, you can assist users in resolving the AADSTS120018 error effectively while ensuring compliance with organizational password policies.

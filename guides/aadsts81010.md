# AADSTS81010: DesktopSsoAuthTokenInvalid - Seamless SSO failed because the user's Kerberos ticket has expired or is invalid.


## Troubleshooting Steps
## Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS81010: DesktopSsoAuthTokenInvalid

### Description
The error code AADSTS81010 signifies that the Seamless Single Sign-On (SSO) has failed due to an expired or invalid Kerberos ticket for the user. This often occurs in environments utilizing Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and authentication mechanisms that rely on Kerberos tickets.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Check User Context**: 
   - Confirm if the affected user is logged onto a domain-joined machine.
   - Ensure the user is utilizing a compatible version of Windows.

2. **Time Synchronization**: 
   - Verify that the client device's clock is synchronized with the domain controller. Kerberos authentication requires that the time is within a few minutes (default is usually 5 minutes).

3. **Inspect Current Kerberos Tickets**: 
   - Open Command Prompt and run `klist` to view the current Kerberos tickets. Check for expiration dates and validity.

4. **Review Event Logs**:
   - Access the Event Viewer on the client machine. 
   - Look for logs in `Windows Logs > Security` and `Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Kerberos > Admin`.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **Expired Kerberos Ticket**: The user's ticket might have expired if they have not accessed any resources that renew it.
2. **Invalid Username or Password**: The user may have changed their password but is still using an old ticket.
3. **Clock Skew**: Often caused by time configuration issues between the client and domain controller.
4. **Network Connectivity Issues**: Problems connecting to the domain controller can lead to issues retrieving a valid Kerberos ticket.
5. **Group Policy Misconfiguration**: If Seamless SSO is not configured correctly in Group Policy, it can lead to failures.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Renew Kerberos Ticket**:
   - Instruct the user to lock the workstation (Windows + L) and then log back in. This should renew the Kerberos ticket.

2. **Reset Password**:
   - If the user has changed their password, ensure they are using the correct credentials. Have them log in to the machine to refresh tickets.

3. **Synchronize Time**:
   - Run `w32tm /resync` in an elevated command prompt to force time synchronization.
   - Also, ensure that the NTP settings are correctly configured in the Windows Time Service.

4. **Check Network Connectivity**:
   - Ensure the client can communicate with the domain controller. Test connectivity using `ping <DC_Name>` or check for appropriate routes and firewall settings.

5. **Reboot the Machine**:
   - Restarting the client machine can sometimes clear transient issues related to authentication.

6. **Review Group Policy Settings**:
   - Check if the group policy settings for Seamless SSO are properly configured. Use `gpresult /h gpresult.html` to generate a report and verify settings.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Make sure that the client is part of the domain and that no recent changes have been made to the domain configuration affecting SSO.
- Ensure that the necessary services related to Kerberos and authentication are running on the client and domain controller.
- Consider whether any recent updates or changes to the environment might have introduced problems (e.g., OS updates, changes to network topology).

### Documentation for Guidance
- **Azure Active Directory Seamless SSO Documentation**: [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis/hybrid-sso)
- **Troubleshooting Kerberos Authentication**: [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/troubleshoot-kerberos-authentication)
- **Active Directory Group Policy Management**: [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/group-policy)

### Advice for Data Collection
1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Collect logs from the Event Viewer that could give insights into authentication failures.
   - Pay special attention to Kerberos-related events, especially Event ID 4768 (Kerberos Authentication Ticket (TGT) Request) and Event ID 4769 (Service Ticket Request).

2. **Network Traces**:
   - Use **Network Monitor** or **Wireshark** to capture traffic that can help diagnose network issues related to domain connectivity.
   - Look for Kerberos traffic and DNS resolution queries.

3. **Fiddler Capture**:
   - If using Fiddler, set it to monitor traffic to identify any failures on authentication requests made to Azure AD.
   - Look for any trending patternsâ€”like missing headers or unexpected status codes.

4. **Logs Output**:
   - If collecting logs via a centralized logging solution, ensure relevant systems (domain controllers, client machines) are included to correlate events.

### Conclusion
By following the above troubleshooting guide, you should be able to identify the root cause of the AADSTS81010 error and implement the appropriate resolution strategy. Always ensure to involve your IT security team if authentication issues persist or expose sensitive information.

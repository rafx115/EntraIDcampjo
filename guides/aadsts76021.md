## Troubleshooting Steps
Error Code: AADSTS76021
Description: ApplicationRequiresSignedRequests - The request sent by the client is not signed while the application requires signed requests.

Troubleshooting Guide:

Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. Verify the error message and error code in the logs or error response.
2. Confirm that the application requires signed requests based on the error description.
3. Check the request sent by the client to validate if it is not signed.
4. Make sure the authentication flow and configurations are set up correctly.

Common Issues:
1. Incorrect application settings: The application might be configured to require signed requests, but the requests sent by the client are not signed.
2. Implementation issue: The client-side code responsible for signing the requests may not be functioning correctly.
3. Token expiration: The token used in the request may have expired, resulting in an unsigned request.

Resolution Strategies:

1. Verify Application Settings:
   - Check the settings of the application to ensure that it requires signed requests for authentication.
   - If the application settings are correct, proceed to the next steps.

2. Implement Request Signing:
   - Modify the client-side code to ensure that requests are signed before sending them to the application.
   - Implement a mechanism to sign the requests using the appropriate algorithm and key.
   - Ensure that the signed requests comply with the requirements of the application.

3. Token Refresh:
   - If the issue is related to token expiration, refresh the token before sending the request.
   - Make sure the token used for authentication is valid and not expired.

Additional Notes or Considerations:
- Ensure that the request signing mechanism is implemented correctly according to the application requirements.
- Double-check the documentation provided by the application for any specific requirements regarding signed requests.
- Test the application thoroughly after implementing the resolution steps to ensure the error is resolved.

By following these troubleshooting steps and resolution strategies, you should be able to address the AADSTS76021 error related to ApplicationRequiresSignedRequests successfully.

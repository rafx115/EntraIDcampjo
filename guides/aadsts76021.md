# AADSTS76021: ApplicationRequiresSignedRequests - The request sent by client is not signed while the application requires signed requests


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS76021 Error Code: ApplicationRequiresSignedRequests

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Confirm Error Code:** Verify that the error code being encountered is indeed AADSTS76021 - ApplicationRequiresSignedRequests.
    
2. **Check Application Configuration:** Ensure that the application settings are configured to require signed requests.
    
3. **Review Request Logs:** Analyze the logs or traces to identify the requests that are failing due to the unsigned nature.

#### Common Issues:
1. **Missing Authentication Token:** The access token required for signing the request may be missing.
    
2. **Incorrect Configuration:** The application might not be correctly configured to enforce signed requests.
    
3. **Request Modification:** The request may have been modified during transit, causing it to lose the required signature.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Verify Token Acquisition:** Ensure that the application correctly acquires the required access token for signing requests.
    
2. **Update Application Configuration:** Adjust the application settings to explicitly require signed requests.
    
3. **Resend Request:** If a request is failing due to lack of signature, regenerate the request and verify that it is properly signed.
    
4. **Debug Request Handling:** Step through the request handling logic to identify any points where the signature is not being added or validated.
    
5. **Check Authorization:** Confirm that the user or client making the request has the necessary permissions and scope to sign requests.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- **Security Considerations:** Unsigned requests pose a security risk, so it's important to enforce signed requests to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
    
- **Token Expiration:** If the access token used for signing requests has expired, it could lead to unsigned requests. Ensure token expiration handling is in place.

#### Documentation:
- For detailed guidance on configuring applications to require signed requests and troubleshooting related issues with Azure Active Directory, refer to the [Microsoft Azure Active Directory documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/). Look for sections related to application settings and security configurations.

By following these steps and considerations, you should be able to diagnose and address the AADSTS76021 error related to unsigned requests effectively.

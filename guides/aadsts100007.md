# AADSTS100007: Microsoft Entra Regional ONLY supports auth either for MSIs OR for requests from MSAL using SN+I for 1P apps or 3P apps in Microsoft infrastructure tenants.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Below is a comprehensive troubleshooting guide for the error code **AADSTS100007** that you've encountered, along with diagnostic steps, common issues, resolution strategies, additional notes, and data collection advice.

### **Error Code Overview**
**Error Code:** AADSTS100007  
**Description:** "Microsoft Entra Regional ONLY supports auth either for MSIs OR for requests from MSAL using SN+I for 1P apps or 3P apps in Microsoft infrastructure tenants."

### **Detailed Troubleshooting Guide**

#### **1. Initial Diagnostic Steps**
- **Identify the Application**: Determine which application is encountering the error.
- **Review Authentication Flow**: Check the authentication flow being used (MSIs, MSAL requests, etc.).
- **Confirm Tenant Type**: Verify if you're working within an infrastructure tenant or another type.
- **Examine Error Context**: Gather information on what triggered the error (e.g., network conditions, specific API calls).

#### **2. Common Issues that Cause this Error**
- **Misconfiguration of Managed Identities**: If using Managed Identities (MSIs), ensure that they are correctly configured and enabled.
- **Incompatible Authentication Methods**: Attempting to use unsupported authentication methods (like non-MSI or legacy methods).
- **Tenant Misidentification**: Ensuring that your app is correctly identified as either a 1P or 3P app and is being authenticated within the right infrastructure tenant.
- **Improper Application Permissions**: The application might lack the necessary permissions to obtain tokens or access resources.

#### **3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies**
- **Validate Managed Identity Configuration**:
  1. Navigate to the Azure portal.
  2. Go to the resource utilizing Managed Identity.
  3. Confirm that the Managed Identity is enabled.
  
- **Review Application Type and Settings**:
  1. Confirm whether the application is classified as 1P or 3P.
  2. In the Azure portal, navigate to “App registrations”.
  3. Verify the application’s settings (redirect URLs, permissions, etc.).

- **Client Application Code Audit**:
  1. Check the authentication code to confirm usage of MSAL properly.
  2. Verify that the app’s client and secret configuration is properly set.

- **Ensure the Correct Authentication Flow**:
  - For Managed Identities, ensure that you're not mixing authentication types.
  - For applications that use MSAL, ensure you are following the recommended practices for using MSAL with Microsoft authentication.

- **Testing Authentication**: Use tools like Postman to manually send requests and test authentication without code to isolate issues.

#### **4. Additional Notes or Considerations**
- **Service Tier**: Be aware that there may be limitations based on service tier or regional availability.
- **Cached Tokens**: Sometimes old or expired tokens can lead to issues; consider clearing any caches.
- **Documentation**: Be sure you refer back to the official Microsoft documentation for updates or specific implementation details.

#### **5. Documentation to Guide Your Steps**
- [Microsoft Entra Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/)
- [Using Managed Identity for Azure Resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)
- [MSAL for .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview)

#### **6. Advice for Data Collection**
- If troubleshooting against a local application or during a session, consider using:
  - **Event Viewer Logs**: Check Windows logs for authentication errors or related entries.
  - **Fiddler or Network Traces**: Capture the HTTP requests and responses to trace the exact point of failure.
  - **Nettrace**: Use nettrace to monitor network requests; helps in identifying connectivity issues or TLS problems.

To collect logs with Fiddler:
- Launch Fiddler and let it capture traffic as you attempt the failed authentication.
- Look for requests to the Microsoft Entra service, examine headers, tokens, and responses.

To collect Event Viewer logs:
- Navigate to Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Application and Security.
- Look for "Microsoft-Windows-Azure" or similar sources for related events.

To use Nettrace:
- Ensure your application is configured to log network events.
- Look for issues related to TLS negotiation, DNS resolution, or connectivity to the authentication endpoint.

### **Conclusion**
By following this structured troubleshooting guide, you should be able to identify the root cause of the AADSTS100007 error and implement appropriate resolutions. Always ensure your systems are up to date and refer to the latest official Microsoft documentation for guidance on authentication and configuration.

# AADSTS81005: DesktopSsoAuthenticationPackageNotSupported - The authentication package isn't supported.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The error code **AADSTS81005**, described as "DesktopSsoAuthenticationPackageNotSupported - The authentication package isn't supported," typically occurs in scenarios involving Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication where the authentication method configured is not compatible with the system or application trying to perform the authentication.

Here's a detailed troubleshooting guide for addressing this error:

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check the Environment**: Confirm if the issue is occurring on a specific device, operating system, or application.
2. **Verify Connectivity**: Ensure that the device has network connectivity and can reach Azure services.
3. **Review Authentication Setup**: Understand how the application is configured for authentication (e.g., using Active Directory, Azure AD, etc.).
4. **Version Check**: Make sure the application and any related libraries (MSAL, ADAL, etc.) are updated to the latest version.

### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **Unsupported Authentication Packages**: The device or OS may not support the required authentication method (e.g., NTLM or Kerberos).
2. **Misconfiguration**: Incorrect settings in application configuration or Azure AD settings can cause compatibility issues.
3. **Outdated Libraries**: Using old versions of SDKs or libraries that do not support the latest authentication protocols.
4. **Local Policy Settings**: Local security policies or domain policies may restrict certain authentication methods.
5. **Microsoft Account vs. Organizational Account**: Attempting to use a consumer Microsoft account instead of an organizational account can lead to this error.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Update Applications**:
   - Ensure that the application is up to date. Check for any available updates in the application store or from the vendor's website.

2. **Review Authentication Methods**:
   - In Azure AD, verify the authentication methods available and configured for your application. You may need to enable the appropriate method.
   - If using configuration files, check and ensure the authentication package being referenced is supported.

3. **Check Compatibility**:
   - Ensure the operating system and application are compatible with the authentication methods used. Review documentation for the application and your environment settings.
   - If on a Windows system, ensure that required features (like .NET versions, Security Package settings) are installed.

4. **Modify Local Security Policy**:
   - If applicable, navigate to `Local Security Policy > Local Policies > Security Options` and check settings related to the authentication package (e.g., "Network security: LAN Manager authentication level").

5. **Testing and Logging**:
   - Use logging to capture any further detailed error messages during the authentication process.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **User Privileges**: Ensure that the user attempting to authenticate does not have any permissions or role-related issues that might inhibit successful authentication.
- **Cross-Platform Issues**: Be aware that some authentication packages might not be available across all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **Network Restrictions**: Check if there are any firewall or network security settings that may be blocking the required authentication endpoints.

### Documentation for Guidance

- **Azure Active Directory documentation**: Microsoft provides extensive documentation on managing authentication methods and troubleshooting common issues:
  - [Azure AD Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)
  - [Troubleshoot AAD issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/troubleshoot-authentication)
  
### Advice for Data Collection

If you're collecting data to analyze the issue:

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Check Windows Event Viewer under **Application and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > User Device Registration** for any relevant errors or warnings.

2. **Network Trace Tools**:
   - Utilize tools like **Network Monitor (NetMon)** or **Wireshark** to capture network traffic and analyze the requests/responses involved in the authentication process.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Capture HTTP/HTTPS requests using **Fiddler** to inspect the authentication request and examine any errors returned from the server.

4. **Application Logs**:
   - If available, check any application-specific logging that may provide insight into the error's context.

By following these steps and considerations, you can systematically troubleshoot and potentially resolve the AADSTS81005 error related to Desktop SSO authentication package support.

# AADSTS700011: UnauthorizedClientAppNotFoundInOrgIdTenant - Application with identifier {appIdentifier} was not found in the directory. A client application requested a token from your tenant, but the client app doesn't exist in your tenant, so the call failed.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Error Code: AADSTS700011 - UnauthorizedClientAppNotFoundInOrgIdTenant

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Confirm the Application Identifier:** Check the identifier {appIdentifier} mentioned in the error message.
2. **Verify Directory/ Tenant Relationship:** Ensure that the client application should belong to the same directory/tenant from which the token is being requested.
3. **Check Client App Registration:** Verify that the client application is registered properly in the Azure Active Directory (AAD) associated with the tenant.

#### Common Issues Causing This Error:
1. **Incorrect Application Identifier:** The provided application identifier in the error message might be incorrect.
2. **Missing Client App Registration:** The client application might not be successfully registered in the AAD of the tenant.
3. **Mismatched Tenant:** The client application resides in a different tenant than the one from which the token is being requested.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Verify Application Identifier:**
    - Double-check the {appIdentifier} mentioned in the error message.
    - Ensure it matches the correct application identifier in the Azure portal.
   
2. **Register Client Application:**
    - Register the client application in the Azure portal of the tenant where the token is being requested.
    - Make sure all necessary details and permissions are correctly configured.
    
3. **Check Tenant & Directory:**
    - Confirm that both the client application and the requesting tenant belong to the same Azure directory.
    - If not, either move the app to the correct directory or make sure to request tokens from the appropriate tenant.

4. **Verify Permissions:**
    - Ensure that the client application has appropriate permissions to request tokens from the AAD.
    - Assign necessary permissions and roles to the client application if required.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- **Error Severity:** This error signifies that the client application requesting the token is not properly registered or is not found in the directory of the tenant.
- **Authorization Flow:** Review the authorization flow and make sure the client application is integrated correctly based on the intended use case.

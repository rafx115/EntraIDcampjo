# AADSTS700011: UnauthorizedClientAppNotFoundInOrgIdTenant - Application with identifier {appIdentifier} was not found in the directory. A client application requested a token from your tenant, but the client app doesn't exist in your tenant, so the call failed.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The error code AADSTS700011 indicates that a client application is attempting to obtain a token from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), but the application identifier is not registered in the Azure AD tenant where the request is being made. Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide divided into sections as requested.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS700011

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Review Error Message**:
   - Verify the identifiers in the error message, especially the `{appIdentifier}`. Note if it is a GUID, a URI, or another form of identifier.

2. **Confirm Tenant Information**:
   - Ensure that you are targeting the correct Azure AD tenant.

3. **Check User Context**:
   - Identify which user is encountering the issue and verify they have appropriate permissions and configurations.

4. **Client Application Details**:
   - Gather information about the client application that is attempting to authenticate, including the application ID and the type of application (Web app, API, etc.).

#### Common Issues that Cause this Error:
1. **Application Not Registered**:
   - The application identified by the `{appIdentifier}` is not registered in the Azure AD tenant.

2. **Incorrect Identifier**:
   - The identifier used in the request does not match the registered application in Azure AD (for example, a mistyped application ID).

3. **Different Tenant**:
   - The client application is registered in a different Azure AD tenant than the one where the token request is being made.

4. **Transient Issues**:
   - Network or transient errors while communicating with Azure AD can sometimes lead to this error.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Verify Application Registration**:
   - Go to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com).
   - Navigate to Azure Active Directory -> App registrations.
   - Look for the application using the identifier in the error message. If itâ€™s not found, you need to register it.

2. **Check Application Identifier**:
   - Ensure that the application ID in the token request is correct and matches the application ID from the Azure portal.

3. **Create or Update the Application Registration**:
   - If the application does not exist, you need to register it:
     - Click on "New Registration".
     - Fill in necessary details (name, redirect URI, etc.).
   - If the application exists but misconfigured, check settings like redirect URIs, API permissions, etc., and update accordingly.

4. **Tenant-Specific Considerations**:
   - If you have multiple Azure AD tenants, ensure that the application is registered in the correct tenant where authentication is being attempted.

5. **Permissions and Roles**:
   - Check if the user requesting the token has necessary roles assigned in Azure AD.

6. **Testing**:
   - After correcting the app registration, conduct tests to ensure that the token can now be successfully retrieved.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- Application registrations can require specific configurations based on the types of permissions and APIs being accessed (e.g., Microsoft Graph).
- If changes are made to the application registration, it may take a few moments for those changes to propagate.

#### Documentation for Guidance:
- Azure Active Directory Applications:
  - [Overview of Azure AD App registrations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)
  - [Troubleshoot Azure AD authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/troubleshoot-authentication)
  - [Manage App Registrations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-manage-apps)

#### Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer, Nettrace, Fiddler):
1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Review the Application and System logs to identify any application-related errors or warnings in the Event Viewer.
   - Search for any instances of the authentication failures that may provide more context.

2. **Network Traces**:
   - Utilize Nettrace or Fiddler to capture HTTP/HTTPS traffic while the application attempts to authenticate.
   - Look for the request and response details related to the access token request. Check for hints on why it might be failing (such as HTTP status codes and response bodies).

3. **Logging**:
   - Ensure that your application has adequate logging to capture error messages that might provide insights into the issue during runtime.

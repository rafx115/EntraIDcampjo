a specific identifier is not found in the directory associated with your tenant.
This error occurs when a client application attempts to request a token from
your tenant but is unable to do so because the client app is not registered in
your tenant.

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:** 

1. Check the specific identifier ({appIdentifier}) mentioned in the error
   message.
2. Verify the tenant directory to see if the client application is indeed
   missing.
3. Review the Azure Active Directory (AAD) logs for more detailed information
   about the failed request.
4. Confirm if the client application has been correctly registered and
   configured in the Azure portal.

**Common Issues Causing the Error:**

   * Sign in to the Azure portal with the appropriate credentials.

   * Navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations.

2. **Verify Tenant Assignment:** 

   * Ensure that the client application is registered in the correct tenant.

   * Check the tenant settings to confirm the application's association with the

     correct directory.

3. **Reconfigure Client Application:** 

   * Update the client application's Azure AD configuration with the correct

     tenant information.
   * Make sure the client application has the required API permissions and

     consent.

4. **Token Request Flow:**    * Repeat the token request from the client 
application after ensuring that

     the application is correctly registered and configured in the tenant.

     request.

# AADSTS230109: CachedCredentialNonGWAuthNRequestsNotSupported - Backup Auth Service only allows AuthN requests from Microsoft Entra Gateway. This error is returned when traffic targets the backup auth service directly instead of going through the reverse proxy.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS230109

#### Error Description
The error code `AADSTS230109` indicates that authentication requests are being directed to the backup authentication service without going through the Microsoft Entra (formerly Azure AD) Gateway. Microsoft’s system architecture does not permit authentication requests to be processed directly by the backup service.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Confirm the Error Source**: Verify the exact error message and context. Confirm whether the error occurs during authentication requests to Azure AD services.
  
2. **Identify Triggering Endpoint**: Determine the endpoint that is being targeted when the error occurs. Verify if it takes a direct path to the backup authentication service.

3. **Check Network Configuration**: Review the network settings and configurations, including proxies, firewalls, and network routes to ensure they conform to Azure's requirements.

### Common Issues that Cause This Error
1. **Direct Traffic to Backup Services**: Misconfiguration directing authentication requests to backup services instead of the gateway.

2. **Improper Application Registration**: Incorrect application configurations in Azure AD could lead to authentication requests not being routed properly.

3. **Network Changes or Firewalls**: Recent changes in network architecture or problematic firewall settings that might be blocking proper routing to the Microsoft Entra Gateway.

4. **Service Interruptions or Issues**: Service disruptions or issues with Microsoft Entra that can divert requests incorrectly.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Ensure Proper Routing**:
   - Check that all authentication requests are routed through the Microsoft Entra Gateway.
   - Update DNS settings or load balancer configurations if necessary to direct traffic appropriately.
  
2. **Verify Application Configuration in Azure AD**:
   - Go to the Azure portal, navigate to Azure Active Directory, and review the application registrations.
   - Verify the **Redirect URIs** and ensure they are properly configured to route through the gateway.

3. **Network Configuration Review**:
   - Check firewall settings and ensure that requests to necessary Azure endpoints are allowed.
   - Review any proxies that might be interfering with the successful routing of requests.

4. **Review Application Code**:
   - If using an application to authenticate users, review the application's authentication flow and ensure it is compatible with Microsoft's recommendations for token requests.

5. **Testing and Validation**:
   - After making configuration adjustments, test the authentication flow.
   - Use tools like Postman to replicate the request and check if it properly goes through the gateway.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that you have the correct permissions set in Azure AD for the application.
- Monitor network traffic to identify paths that are not following the expected routes.
- Consider retries or alternate routes while investigating longer outages on the Microsoft Entra Gateway.

### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**: Collect logs related to authentication processes. Look for events under **Windows Logs > Application** and **Security** that may detail authentication attempts or failures.
  
- **Network Traces**: Use **NetTrace** or **Wireshark** to capture traffic during the authentication process. Look specifically for traffic to and from Azure endpoints.

- **Fiddler or browser developer tools**: Monitor HTTP requests made during the authentication process to see if they correctly target the expected gateway endpoints. Pay attention to the `Location` headers in the responses which indicate redirection paths.

By following these steps and strategies, you should be able to resolve the `AADSTS230109` error effectively and ensure your application’s authentication requests are correctly routed through the Microsoft Entra Gateway.

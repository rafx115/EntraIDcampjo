# AADSTS700229: ForbiddenTokenType- Only app-only tokens can be used as Federated Identity Credentials for Microsoft Entra issuer. Use an app-only access token (generated during a client credentials flow) instead of a user-delegated access token (representing a request coming from a user context).


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Error code **AADSTS700229** indicates that there is an issue with the type of token being used for federated identity credentials in Microsoft Entra (formerly Azure Active Directory). The error specifically notes that only app-only tokens can be used, meaning that the system is expecting a token that was generated in the context of a service principal (client credentials flow) and not a user-delegated access token.

Here's a detailed troubleshooting guide to help resolve this error.

### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps

- **Identify the Context**: Determine under which circumstance the error occurs. Is it during an API call or when acquiring a token?
- **Check Token Type**: Examine the type of access token being requested. Is it a user-delegated token (indicating a user sign-in) or an app-only token?
- **Review Application Permissions**: Look at the application permissions you've configured in Azure AD. Ensure the permissions match your intended use case.

### 2. Common Issues that Cause This Error

- **Incorrect Token Flow**: Attempting to use a user-delegated token instead of an app-only token.
- **Improper Configuration of Federated Identity Credentials**: The applicationâ€™s identity settings may not be configured correctly in Azure AD.
- **Misconfigured Permissions**: The application may lack the necessary permissions for its service principal to acquire the required app-only token.

### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

#### a. Verify Token Flow

1. **Check your Authentication Method**:
   - Confirm that you are using the client credentials grant flow when attempting to acquire the token.
   - This can typically be done via an OAuth 2.0 token request formatted correctly for app-only scenarios.

2. **Acquire an App-Only Token**:
   - Use tools like Postman or a script to call the token endpoint.
   - Example of a request using client credentials:
     ```http
     POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

     grant_type=client_credentials
     &client_id={your-client-id}
     &client_secret={your-client-secret}
     &scope=https://{api-scope}/.default
     ```

3. **Inspect the Token**: Use a JWT decoder (like jwt.io) to inspect the claims and ensure that the token is indeed an app-only token.

#### b. Review Federated Identity Credentials Configuration

1. **Verify Identity Configuration**:
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to your application and check the "Identity" settings under "Security" to ensure that the federated identity credentials are correctly set up for the corresponding Azure AD issuer.

2. **Ensure Correct API Permissions**:
   - Within the Azure portal, go to the "API permissions" section and confirm that the app has the correct permissions granted for accessing the resources it needs.

3. **Check Consent**: Make sure admin consent has been granted for the necessary permissions if required.

### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Monitor for Changes**: Be aware if any changes were made recently in Azure AD configurations that might have affected the application and token generation processes.
- **Security Considerations**: Ensure that the app secret or certificate used for the client credential flow is not expired or compromised.

### 5. Documentation for Guidance

Refer to the following official Microsoft documentation for guidance on fix steps and configurations:

- [Microsoft Entra authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)
- [How to use the OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow)
- [Azure Active Directory Permissions Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-azure-ads-graph-api-permissions)

Make sure to test that these links are reachable and up-to-date as part of your troubleshooting process.

### 6. Advice for Data Collection

- **Log Requests and Responses**: Capture the HTTP requests, especially token acquisition attempts. Log response codes and messages for debugging.
- **Use Fiddler or Network Traces**: Consider using network tracing tools (e.g., Fiddler) to see the exact requests being sent to Azure AD.
- **Gather Environment Context**: Collect context about the environment (development, production, etc.) and relevant configuration details when collecting data.

# AADSTS700229: ForbiddenTokenType- Only app-only tokens can be used as Federated Identity Credentials for Microsoft Entra issuer. Use an app-only access token (generated during a client credentials flow) instead of a user-delegated access token (representing a request coming from a user context).


## Troubleshooting Steps
## Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS700229

### Description
The error code AADSTS700229 indicates that a token of an incorrect type was used when attempting to authenticate against Microsoft Entra (formerly Azure AD). This specific error message signifies that only app-only tokens can be used for Federated Identity Credentials, and that a user-delegated access token was mistakenly used.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify the Token Type**: Confirm whether the access token used in your request is an app-only token or a user-delegated token. This can usually be checked in the token's claims, specifically looking for `scp` (scope) claims or audience (`aud`).

2. **Check Application Context**: Verify the context in which your application is running. If running in a non-user context (service or background job), ensure that the proper authentication flow is being used.

3. **Review Application Permissions**: Ensure that the application has permissions configured correctly to request an app-only token.

4. **Verify Federation Settings**: If applicable, confirm the configuration settings for Federated Identity Credentials in Microsoft Entra.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **Incorrect Authentication Flow**: Attempting to acquire a token using a user-delegated flow (like authorization code flow or on-behalf-of flow) instead of a client credentials flow.

2. **Misconfigured Application Registration**: The app may not have the required permissions set up properly for obtaining app-only tokens.

3. **Incorrect Token Audience**: The application might be trying to access a resource that requires a different audience than what was configured.

4. **Federated Identity Misconfiguration**: The method of applying federated identity does not meet the requirements set by Microsoft Entra.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Ensure Using Client Credentials Flow**:
   - Confirm that the application is configured to use the client credentials flow. Refer to:
     - [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview) for implementation details.
   - Use the following example to acquire an app-only token:
     ```python
     from msal import ConfidentialClientApplication

     app = ConfidentialClientApplication(
         client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
         client_credential="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
         authority="https://login.microsoftonline.com/YOUR_TENANT_ID"
     )

     token_response = app.acquire_token_for_client(scopes=["https://YOUR_RESOURCE/.default"])
     ```

2. **Review Permissions**:
   - Check that the application has the right API permissions under **API Permissions** in the Azure portal, and that they are granted admin consent.
   - Grant the “Application” permissions instead of “Delegated” permissions.

3. **Token Inspection**:
   - Use a tool like [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/) to decode the JWT token and check the claims, ensuring that it matches what is expected for an app-only access token.
   - Go through the `aud` and `scp` claims to verify proper configuration.

4. **Apply Correct Federated Identity Configuration**:
   - Adjust the settings for Federated Identity Credentials in Microsoft Entra to accommodate app-only usage.
   - Reference documentation for configuring Federated Identity with the correct settings.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Always ensure that secret key storage respects security best practices and complies with your organization’s policies.
- Regularly review permission scopes and grant admin consent as necessary to avoid outages due to permission issues.
- Make sure that you're testing with the correct endpoints and that your application settings align with your Azure AD configuration.

### Advice for Data Collection
If further troubleshooting is necessary, consider collecting the following data:
- **Event Viewer Logs**: Look for logs related to authentication failures or token acquisition in the Event Viewer on the machine running the application.
- **Network Traces**: Use tools like Fiddler, Wireshark, or NetMon to capture request-response cycles, including tokens and headers.

1. **Capture Fiddler Trace**:
   - Ensure that Fiddler is installed and running.
   - Go to `Tools` → `Options` → `HTTPS` and enable decryption.
   - Analyze the requests made to the authentication endpoints.

2. **Use Nettrace**:
   - Capture detailed logs regarding network issues by following the instructions on enabling and collecting traces.

By following this troubleshooting guide, the aim is to resolve the AADSTS700229 error effectively while ensuring proper token usage is implemented in applications accessing Microsoft Entra.

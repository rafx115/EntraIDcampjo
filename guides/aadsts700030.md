# AADSTS700030: Invalid certificate - subject name in certificate isn't authorized. SubjectNames/SubjectAlternativeNames (up to 10) in token certificate are: {certificateSubjects}.


## Troubleshooting Steps
**Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS700030**

### Overview

Error code AADSTS700030 generally signifies an issue with the authentication certificate used in your application. Specifically, the error indicates that the subject name in the certificate is not authorized for the action being performed. This can occur when the certificate is either misconfigured or the wrong certificate is being used.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify the Context**: Determine when and where the error occurs (e.g., during sign-in, API call, etc.). Understand whether itâ€™s a web app, service principal, or another type of application.
  
2. **Check User Context**: Confirm if the error is consistent across different user accounts or specific to only certain accounts.

3. **Review Application Logs**: Check your application logs to see if there are any additional error messages or stack traces that provide more context.

### Common Issues that Cause this Error

1. **Incorrect Subject Name**: The subject name of the certificate does not match the expected names in Azure Active Directory (AAD). 

2. **Expired Certificate**: The certificate has expired or is not yet valid.

3. **Mismatched Applications**: The application using the certificate is not the one registered in Azure AD.

4. **Wrong Authentication Authority**: The application may be using an incorrect tenant or authentication authority.

5. **Misconfigured API Permissions**: The API permissions for the application may not be correctly set up.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

#### Step 1: Validate the Certificate

- **Check Certificate Properties**: Ensure the certificate has a valid subject name that aligns with what is expected in Azure AD. Look for:
  - Subject Name (CN)
  - Subject Alternative Names (SAN)

- **Renew or Replace the Certificate**: If the certificate is expired or about to expire, regenerate and install a new certificate.

#### Step 2: Check Certificate Installation

- **Certificate Installation**: Ensure the certificate is correctly installed in the correct store (for example, local machine or user store depending on your application type).
  
- **Access Rights**: Verify that the application has access rights to the private key of the installed certificate.

#### Step 3: Verify Application Registration

- **Open Azure Portal**: Navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations.

- **Locate Correct Application**: Ensure you are looking at the correct application registration that uses the certificate.

- **Application Identifier**: Check the application's client ID and ensure it matches what is being used in your application.

#### Step 4: Review Authentication Settings

- **Review Authentication Flow**: If using OAuth, ensure that the correct flow is being used (Authorization Code, Client Credentials, etc.).

- **Tenant Configuration**: Verify you are configuring the right Azure AD tenant (consider the tenant ID, if applicable).

#### Step 5: Adjust API Permissions

- **API Permissions Page**: Go to the API permissions section in the Azure AD app registration and ensure all required permissions are granted and the admin consent is provided.

- **Grant Admin Consent**: If necessary, ensure proper admin consent is given for the permissions your application requires.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Team Collaboration**: If this error is affecting a team, ensure good communication regarding any changes made to certificates or application configurations.

- **Documentation**: Regularly refer to Microsoft's documentation for updates on certificate management and Azure AD configurations.

### Documentation for Guidance

- [Microsoft Docs: Use a certificate to authenticate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-certificate-authentication)
- [Microsoft Docs: Understanding Azure AD error codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios#error-codes)
- [Azure AD app registrations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)

### Advice for Data Collection

If further diagnosis is necessary, gather data as follows:

1. **Event Viewer Logs**: 
   - Navigate to Windows Event Viewer > Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > AzureAD.
   - Check for Errors or Warnings related to authentication.

2. **Network Traces**:
   - Use tools like [NetTrace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/netsh) or [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) to capture the traffic and look for any anomalies in the requests being sent to Azure AD.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Use Fiddler to capture HTTP traffic. Configure your app to send requests through Fiddler and inspect the traffic for errors or unexpected responses from AAD.

By following this detailed guide, you should be able to troubleshoot and resolve error AADSTS700030 effectively.

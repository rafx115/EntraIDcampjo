### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS70016 Error Code: AuthorizationPending

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Confirm the Error Message**: Make sure the error message you received is indeed "AADSTS70016 - AuthorizationPending".

2. **Device Flow**: Understand that this error is related to the OAuth 2.0 device flow, where the authorization process is not yet complete.

3. **Check Authorization Status**: Verify if the authorization is stuck in a pending state and see if the device is attempting to retry polling the request.

#### Common Issues:
1. **Slow Network Connection**: A slow or unstable network can cause delays in completing the authorization process.

2. **Incorrect Device Code**: Incorrect entry of the device code during the authorization process can lead to the pending status.

3. **Issues with Authorization Server**: Temporary issues or downtime on the authorization server can cause authorization delays.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

    - Ensure your device has a stable internet connection.
    - Test the connection speed to rule out network-related issues.

2. **Verify Device Code Entry**:
    - Double-check the device code entered during the authorization process.
    - Make sure there are no typos in the code.

3. **Retry Authorization**:
    - If the authorization is pending, allow more time for the device to retry polling the request.
    - You may need to wait a bit longer for the authorization to go through.

4. **Clear Cache**:
    - Clearing cache and cookies on your device can sometimes resolve temporary authorization issues.

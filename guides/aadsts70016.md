# AADSTS70016: AuthorizationPending - OAuth 2.0 device flow error. Authorization is pending. The device will retry polling the request.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS70016: AuthorizationPending

**Overview:**  
The error code AADSTS70016 indicates that during the OAuth 2.0 device flow authentication process, authorization is still pending and the device is retrying to poll for the response. This error can cause delays in the OAuth flow and needs to be addressed.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Confirm the Error:**  
   - Reproduce the issue to ensure that the error indeed occurs as described.
   - Note down the exact time and methods used for the authentication attempt.

2. **Check Network Connectivity:**  
   - Ensure that the device youâ€™re using for the OAuth flow has a stable internet connection.

3. **Review the Device Flow URL and Code:**  
   - Verify that the device code and the user code are correctly entered on the sign-in page.
   - Ensure that the device is polling the correct URL.

4. **Monitor Timing Issues:**  
   - Record how long it takes for the user to enter the provided user code on another device (there's usually a time limit).

### Common Issues that Cause this Error

1. **Delay in User Authentication:**  
   - If the user takes too long to authenticate using the provided user code, the authorization process may time out.

2. **Misconfigurations:**  
   - Misconfigured Azure AD application settings, such as redirect URIs or permissions, could lead to authorization issues.

3. **Network Issues:**  
   - Intermittent network connectivity problems can cause delays in authorization polling.

4. **Incorrect Scopes:**  
   - If you request permissions that the user has not consented to or are incorrect in the context of the application.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Increase User Awareness:**
   - Inform users to enter the user code promptly and complete the authentication process within the timeframe.

2. **Check Azure AD Application Settings:**
   - Log into the Azure portal.
   - Go to Azure Active Directory > App Registrations > Your Application.
   - Review the **Redirect URIs** and **API permissions**.
   - Ensure the required permissions are granted and consented.

3. **Review Logs for Issues:**
   - Use Azure AD sign-in logs to identify failed sign-in attempts.
   - Azure AD > Monitoring > Sign-ins.
   - Look for entries related to the AADSTS70016 error.

4. **Test Different Devices/Browsers:**
   - Attempt the authorization flow from a different device or browser to rule out device-specific issues.

5. **Adjust Network Configuration:**
   - If a firewall or proxy might be blocking requests, ensure that necessary endpoints for Azure AD are accessible.

6. **Recheck OAuth Request:**
   - Review the request settings made during the authentication flow. Ensure parameters such as **scope**, **client_id**, and **client_secret** are correct.
   - Example request:
     ```http
     POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/devicecode
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
     
     client_id={client_id}&scope={scopes}
     ```

7. **Implementation of Polling Strategy:**
   - Implement exponential backoff for polling the status, which might help in reducing the load and potentially avoid immediate retry conflicts.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **User Session:** After a user successfully authenticates, ensure proper session maintenance to avoid needing repeated token generations which may cause additional authorization pending states.
  
- **Token Expiration:** Be mindful of the expiration times for access tokens and refresh tokens, and implement appropriate handling in your application.

### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - Check Windows Event Viewer for any related application or system errors that may provide insight into connectivity issues.
   - Look under Windows Logs > Application/System.

2. **Network Traces:**
   - Use a network tracing tool to inspect traffic during the authentication process (e.g., `netsh trace start`).

3. **Fiddler or Similar Proxy:**
   - Utilize Fiddler to capture and inspect HTTP(S) traffic between the client and Azure AD to uncover any anomalies in requests and responses.
   - Ensure HTTPS traffic is decrypted by installing the Fiddler root certificate.

# AADSTS140000: InvalidRequestNonce - Request nonce isn't provided.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide for the error code AADSTS140000 with the description "InvalidRequestNonce - Request nonce isn't provided."

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS140000 Error

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify Context**: Determine the context in which the error occurs. Is it during a web app sign-in, mobile app authentication, or API call? Note the platforms and technologies involved.
  
2. **Check Error Logs**: Review the application logs or Azure AD sign-in logs to gather more information about the specific request that resulted in the error.

3. **Reproduce the Error**: If possible, try to replicate the issue using the same credentials and environment settings. Note any patterns or specific conditions that lead to the error.

#### Common Issues that Cause this Error

1. **Missing Nonce Parameter**: The error often indicates that the nonce parameter is not included in the authentication request.

2. **Malformed Request**: The request to Azure AD may be incorrectly formatted.

3. **Mismatched Redirect URIs**: Ensure the redirect URI registered in Azure AD matches what your application is sending.

4. **Session State Issues**: If the application does not maintain proper session state, it can lead to missing nonce values.

5. **Browser Extensions or Ad Blockers**: Sometimes, browser extensions can interfere with authentication flows, potentially stripping out necessary parameters.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Update Authentication Code**:
   - Ensure that your application includes a nonce parameter when making requests to Azure AD for authentication. A nonce is a unique value that helps prevent replay attacks.
   - Example (in JavaScript):
     ```javascript
     const nonce = generateNonce();  // Generate a secure random nonce
     const authRequest = {
         response_type: "id_token",
         nonce: nonce,
         // ... other parameters
     };
     ```
   
2. **Check Your Configuration**:
   - Double-check that you have set up your Azure AD application and that the redirect URLs match what you are using in your application code.
   - Go to Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > App registrations > Your Application > Authentication.

3. **Inspect Your Application's State Management**:
   - Ensure that your application properly handles session state and retains the nonce value across redirects.
   - Using local storage or session storage may help to maintain the nonce during the authentication flow.

4. **Test Without Extensions**:
   - If you suspect that a browser extension might be causing the issue, try to authenticate using an incognito window or a different browser without any extensions installed.

5. **Logging and Debugging**:
   - Enhance logging around your authentication requests to capture the state and parameters sent during the request. This will provide insights into what exactly is sent to Azure AD.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Nonce Security**: Always ensure the nonce value is unique for each authentication request and is securely generated to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- **Cross-Origin Concerns**: If your app is a single-page application (SPA) using frameworks like React or Angular, ensure that your handling of cross-origin requests is correctly configured.

#### Documentation for Guidance

- Azure Active Directory Authentication Documentation: [Microsoft Doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/)

#### Advice for Data Collection

1. Gather error logs related to the authentication flow and extract details such as timestamps, IP addresses, and the specific error messages returned.
2. Collect HTTP request and response data, including URL parameters, HTTP headers, and the body if applicable, for both successful and failed attempts.
3. Note down the client application version, libraries used (like MSAL), and any HTTP client configurations that may vary from standard practices.

By following this guide, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the AADSTS140000 error effectively. If issues persist, consider reaching out to Microsoft Support for further assistance.

# AADSTS140000: InvalidRequestNonce - Request nonce isn't provided.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS140000: "InvalidRequestNonce - Request nonce isn't provided"

#### **Initial Diagnostic Steps**
1. **Identify the Context**: Determine when this error occurs - during authentication, while accessing a service, or integrating an application with Azure AD.
2. **Check Application Configuration**: Verify if the application is correctly configured to use OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect.
3. **Review the Request**: Examine the HTTP request sent to the Azure AD endpoint, specifically inspecting the presence of the `nonce` parameter.

#### **Common Issues that Cause This Error**
- **Missing Nonce Parameter**: The `nonce` parameter is not included in the authentication request.
- **Improper Application Manifest Configuration**: The application registration may need proper settings related to implicit flow or response types.
- **Session/Token Caching Issues**: Prior requests or cached tokens might cause inconsistencies leading to missing parameters.
- **Incorrect Code Flow Implementation**: If implementing a specific flow (like authorization code flow), ensure that all required parameters are correctly implemented.

#### **Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies**
1. **Include the Nonce Parameter**:
   - Ensure that when initiating the authentication request, the `nonce` parameter is included. This should be a unique, unpredictable value.

   Example of an authorization request with nonce:
   ```
   https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize
   ?client_id={client_id}
   &response_type=code
   &redirect_uri={redirect_uri}
   &scope={scopes}
   &state={state}
   &nonce={random_string}
   ```

2. **Validate Application Registration**:
   - Access the Azure portal and navigate to "Azure Active Directory".
   - Select "App registrations", and choose your application.
   - Under "Authentication", ensure that the platform-specific settings and redirect URIs are appropriately set up. 

3. **Check Response Type**:
   - Ensure the correct `response_type` is being used based on your application flow.
   - Refer to Azure documentation for your specific use case related to OAuth flows and ensure you're using the correct parameters.

4. **Review Client-side Implementation**:
   - In your application code, confirm that the request generation logic includes a nonce and ensure chronological uniqueness.

5. **Debug and Test**:
   - Test the authentication flow in a controlled environment.
   - Use tools or libraries that abstract and manage the authentication state and implement nonce generation automatically.

#### **Additional Notes or Considerations**
- **State Parameter**: Although the error mentions the `nonce`, ensure you are also managing the `state` parameter correctly to maintain the integrity of the session during redirects.
- **Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: If applicable, check if CORS issues could be interfering with the authentication process, especially in browser-based applications.

#### **Documentation for Guidance**
- [Microsoft OAuth 2.0 Authorization code flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow)
- [Microsoft Identity Platform documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/)
- [Nonces in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#nonce)

#### **Advice for Data Collection**
- **Event Viewer Logs**: On Windows systems, check the Event Viewer under "Windows Logs" > "Application" for any errors related to the application.
- **Network Tracing (NetTrace)**: Use tools like Microsoft Network Monitor or Wireshark to capture the traffic and validate that the `nonce` parameter is included in outgoing requests.
- **Fiddler**: If applicable, configure Fiddler to capture HTTP traffic and inspect the full request to Azure AD, including headers and parameters.
- **Browser Developer Tools**: Use the Network tab in browser developer tools (F12) to monitor outgoing requests and confirm the structure and parameters of the request to identify if `nonce` is missing or improperly formatted.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the AADSTS140000 error effectively. If the issue persists, further detailed logs and possibly reaching out to Azure support may be necessary.

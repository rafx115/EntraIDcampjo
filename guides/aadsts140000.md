### Troubleshooting Guide: AADSTS140000 Error Code - InvalidRequestNonce

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Verify Error Description:** Ensure that the error code is indeed AADSTS140000 with InvalidRequestNonce error message.
2. **Check Request Parameters:** Confirm that the request includes the necessary parameters, specifically the nonce.

#### Common Issues:
1. **Missing Nonce Parameter:** The nonce value is a crucial part of the request for security purposes.
2. **Incorrect Nonce Format:** The nonce should be uniquely generated for each request and follow the required format.
3. **Nonce Expiry:** If the nonce has expired, it can cause this error.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Regenerate Nonce:** Generate a new nonce value to include in the request.
2. **Check Nonce Format:** Ensure that the nonce follows the required format, typically a random string.
3. **Include Nonce in Request:** Make sure the nonce parameter is correctly added to the request.
4. **Check Nonce Expiry:** If the nonce has an expiration time, ensure it is within the valid timeframe.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- **Security Concerns:** Nonce is used for preventing replay attacks, so it's important to handle it securely.
- **API Documentation:** Refer to the authentication provider's API documentation for specific nonce requirements.
- **Token Expiry:** Nonce validity may be linked to the token's expiry time, so consider token management as well.

By following these troubleshooting steps and ensuring the correct handling of the nonce parameter, you should be able to address the AADSTS140000 InvalidRequestNonce error effectively. Remember to test the changes thoroughly to verify that the issue has been resolved.

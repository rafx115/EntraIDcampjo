# AADSTS1000104: XCB2BResourceCloudNotAllowedOnIdentityTenant - Resource cloud {resourceCloud} isn't allowed on identity tenant {identityTenant}. {resourceCloud} - cloud instance which owns the resource. {identityTenant} - is the tenant where signing-in identity is originated from.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS1000104 Error

#### Error Description
- **Error Code**: AADSTS1000104
- **Description**: `XCB2BResourceCloudNotAllowedOnIdentityTenant`
- **Meaning**: This error indicates that the resource cloud (e.g., Azure service) is not allowed on the identity tenant from which the user is signing in.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Verify the Error Message**:
   - Ensure you note the exact wording of the error, focusing on `{resourceCloud}` and `{identityTenant}` to understand which resources and tenants are involved.

2. **Identify the User's Tenant**:
   - Determine the Azure Active Directory (AAD) tenant the user is associated with.
   - Use the Azure portal or Azure AD management tools.

3. **Check Resource Configuration**:
   - Identify the resource (e.g., application, service) this error refers to and verify its configuration.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **Incorrect Resource Cloud Configuration**:
   - The configured resource cloud does not support the user’s tenant. This may happen if a resource is hosted in a different Azure cloud (e.g., Azure Government, Azure China) than where the user’s tenant is.

2. **Multi-Tenant Settings**:
   - If the application or resource is designed for multi-tenancy, but not properly configured, it may restrict users from certain tenants from accessing the resource.

3. **Cross-Tenant Restrictions**:
   - Azure may enforce restrictions on access when tenants are not configured to allow relationships or access between different cloud instances.

4. **Identity Verification**:
   - A misconfigured identity provider can lead to issues if the identity is not recognized in the context.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
#### Step 1: Confirm Resource and Identity Compatibility
- Check if the specified `resourceCloud` accepts identities from the `identityTenant`.
- Azure resources should have the setting adjusted if they involve multi-tenancy.

#### Step 2: Modify Resource Access Settings
- If applicable, update the settings in the Azure portal:
  - Navigate to the resource in question.
  - Check under "Authentication" or "Access Control (IAM)".
  - Update permission levels to allow access for additional tenants or identities.

#### Step 3: Validate Tenant Configuration
- If your application is running in a specific region or cloud, ensure that the necessary configurations are set to allow identities from the correct tenant to access the resource.
- In the Azure portal, review the directory settings under Azure Active Directory > Properties.

#### Step 4: Review Application Configuration
- If integrating an application, ensure that the application manifest allows for the necessary permissions and that it supports identities from all required tenants.

#### Step 5: Log Verbose Information
- Enable detailed logging for Azure AD operations and any associated application for debugging and review. This typically involves:
  - Using App Insight for reporting.
  - Azure AD audit logs for identifying any authentication issues.
  
### Additional Notes or Considerations
- If the error relates to a development environment, ensure that all endpoints and configurations are properly set for both client and server settings.
- For Azure Government or specialized clouds (e.g., Azure China), cross-cloud permissions may require specific setups not applicable in commercial Azure.

### Advice for Data Collection (Logs)
- **Event Viewer Logs**:
  - Collect relevant logs from the Event Viewer, especially under ‘Applications and Services Logs’ > ‘Microsoft’ > ‘Windows’ > ‘AAD’ for potential error messages linked to authentication failures.
  
- **Network Traces**:
  - Use `nettrace` (Microsoft's Network Tracing tool) for capturing network packets if needed.

- **Fiddler**:
  - Use Fiddler to capture web traffic relevant to the authentication requests to analyze authentication flows, check for redirects, and monitor responses.

Collecting the above logs will help in troubleshooting the issue further and provide insight into exactly where the process is failing.

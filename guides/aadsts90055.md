## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS90055 - TenantThrottlingError

#### Error Description:
The AADSTS90055 error indicates a throttling issue due to too many incoming requests directed to Azure Active Directory (AAD) for a specific tenant. This is a protective mechanism to ensure the stability and performance of the service. The error message "There are too many incoming requests. This exception is thrown for blocked tenants." suggests that the tenant is experiencing too high a load.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Check Azure Status**: Verify if there are any ongoing performance issues with Azure AD by visiting the [Azure Status Page](https://status.azure.com/).
2. **Review Application Logs**:
   - Gather application logs where the authentication requests are initiated and see if there are spikes in the request rates.
3. **Identify Request Patterns**: Identify if there are specific requests or actions that cause spikes. 
4. **Determine the Tenant Status**: Confirm the tenant you are working with is not in a suspended or blocked state through Azure Portal.

### Common Issues that Cause This Error:
- **Excessive User Authentication Requests**: Repeated login attempts, especially in a short time (for example, due to poorly managed loops in the application logic).
- **High Volume of Requests**: Bulk operations or requests initiated by scripts or applications without appropriate throttling.
- **Misconfigured Applications**: Applications continuously retrying failed requests can overwhelm the AAD.
- **Third-party Integrations**: Applications that are integrating with Azure AD causing multiple requests rapidly.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Throttle Your Requests**:
   - Implement exponential back-off for retry logic in your applications. If you receive this error, pause and slow down your request rate.
   - Modify the application to limit the frequency of authentication requests.

2. **Optimize Authentication Flows**:
   - Ensure that your applications use [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) and [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) correctly to reduce repeated logins.
   - Utilize token caching effectively. Once a user is authenticated, cache the token to avoid unnecessary re-authentication.

3. **Batch Requests Wisely**:
   - If you're performing bulk operations, aggregate requests and batch them if possible, rather than making individual requests rapidly.

4. **Monitor and Adjust Application Load**:
   - Use Azure Monitor or Application Insights to track requests and identify patterns of excessive load.
   - Adjust the application architecture if you find it generates more load than necessary.

5. **Increase Resource Quota**:
   - If your application continually requires excessive requests but it is legitimate, consider contacting Azure support to discuss increasing your quota limits.

6. **Engage with Microsoft Support**:
   - If you cannot resolve the issue via the above steps, create a support ticket with Microsoft detailing your observations and request assistance.

### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- Be mindful of Azure AD's service limits and design your applications accordingly to stay within those limits.
- If youâ€™re developing in a multi-tenant scenario, ensure your application properly handles requests across different tenants without overwhelming AAD.

### Documentation References:
- Official Microsoft Documentation on throttling: [Azure AD Throttling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#throttling)
- Overview of API Error Responses: [AAD Error Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aad-tenant-error-codes)
- Best Practices in Azure AD Authentication: [Azure Active Directory Authentication Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)

### Advice for Data Collection:
1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Collect logs from the Event Viewer focusing on Application and System logs related to the timeframe of the issue.
   
2. **Network Traces**:
   - Utilize [NetTrace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/netmon) or the built-in network tracing tools in your development environment to capture request patterns.
   
3. **Fiddler**:
   - Use Fiddler or similar HTTP debugging tools to monitor incoming and outgoing requests during the authentication attempts to capture relevant headers and response codes.

By systematically following this troubleshooting guide, you should be able to identify the cause of the AADSTS90055 error and effectively resolve it.

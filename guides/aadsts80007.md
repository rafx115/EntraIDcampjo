# AADSTS80007: OnPremisePasswordValidatorErrorOccurredOnPrem - The Authentication Agent is unable to validate user's password. Check the agent logs for more info and verify that Active Directory is operating as expected.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS80007: OnPremisePasswordValidatorErrorOccurredOnPrem

**Description:** The error code AADSTS80007 indicates that the Authentication Agent (also known as the Azure AD Connect Authentication Agent) is having difficulty validating a user’s password against the on-premises Active Directory. 

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check Agent Status:**
   - Verify that the Azure AD Connect Authentication Agent service is running on the server where it is installed.
   - Use the Azure AD Connect UI to check the agent’s health status.

2. **Review Authentication Agent Logs:**
   - Access the logs stored on the server where the Authentication Agent is installed. For installation, it is typically located at:
     - `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft Azure AD Authentication Agent\Logs`
   - Look for any error messages or logs that pertain to password validation.

3. **Check Active Directory Availability:**
   - Ensure that the Active Directory is reachable from the server on which the Authentication Agent is installed.
   - Use tools such as `ping`, `nslookup`, or `telnet` to verify network connectivity.
   - Check if there are any issues with Active Directory domain controllers (e.g., replication issues, service outages).

### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Authentication Agent Misconfiguration:**
   - Incorrect configuration of the Authentication Agent regarding domain connections or credentials.

2. **Network Issues:**
   - Firewalls, proxy settings, or network outages preventing access to Active Directory.

3. **Active Directory Health:**
   - Domain controllers being offline or experiencing performance issues.
   - Replication issues among domain controllers.

4. **Service Account Permissions:**
   - The service account used by the Authentication Agent might not have sufficient permissions to read user credentials.

5. **Password Policy Issues:**
   - The password being used might not meet the Active Directory password policy requirements.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify Agent Configuration:**
   - Check the Authentication Agent settings in the Azure AD Connect console.
   - Re-enter the credentials for the service account if necessary.
   - Confirm the domain and associated settings are correct.

2. **Test Connectivity:**
   - Confirm that you can reach the domain controllers via the Authentication Agent.
   - Use PowerShell to test LDAP access:
     ```powershell
     Test-Connection -ComputerName <DomainControllerName>
     ```
   - Check port access for LDAP/LDAPS:
     - LDAP (TCP 389)
     - LDAPS (TCP 636)

3. **Check Event Logs:**
   - Review the Windows Event Viewer under **Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Azure AD Authentication Agent** for any specific logs related to authentication failures.

4. **Review Active Directory Health:**
   - Use tools like `dcdiag` and `repadmin` to check the health of your Active Directory environment.
   - Remember to check if the Directory Services and DNS services are running.

5. **Permissions Validation:**
   - Ensure that the service account has read access to the password attribute and is part of necessary groups (e.g., domain users).

6. **Monitor and Adjust Password Policies:**
   - Check that the user’s password complies with the domain password policy and ensure there are no account lockouts due to exceeded attempts.

7. **Restart Services:**
   - Restart the Authentication Agent service, and in some cases, a system reboot of the server where the agent is installed may resolve lingering issues.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Logging Level Adjustment**: If the logs do not provide sufficient detail, consider increasing the logging level of the Authentication Agent for next troubleshooting iterations.
- **Latest Updates**: Ensure that the Authentication Agent software is up to date; Microsoft may release patches that fix known issues.
- **Documentation Links**: 
  - [Azure AD Connect: Authentication Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/deploy-authentication-agent)

### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Event Viewer Logs**: Capture the logs from the Azure AD Authentication Agent logs in Event Viewer (Windows Event Logs).
2. **Network Trace**: Use `nettrace` or similar tools to capture network traffic while performing the authentication request for deeper insight.
3. **Fiddler**: If the issue seems related to HTTP(S) communications, capturing HTTP requests using Fiddler can help reveal configuration or unexpected behaviors.

**Feedback and Reporting**: If the issue persists after following the above steps, consider submitting a support request to Microsoft through your Azure subscription for further assistance, including the collected logs and diagnostics.

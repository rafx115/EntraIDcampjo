### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS80007 Error Code: OnPremisePasswordValidatorErrorOccurredOnPrem


#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:

1. **Check Agent Logs**: Begin by reviewing the logs of the Authentication Agent
   for any specific error messages or clues related to the password validation
   issue.
2. **Verify Active Directory Status**: Confirm that Active Directory (AD)
   services are running properly and are accessible from the Authentication
   Agent.
3. **User Authentication Testing**: Test the affected user's login credentials
   on other devices or systems to check if the issue is specific to the
   Authentication Agent.
4. **Network Connectivity**: Ensure that there are no network connectivity
   issues between the Authentication Agent and the Active Directory server.


#### Common Issues Causing AADSTS80007 Error:

1. **Incorrect Configuration**: Misconfiguration of the Authentication Agent
   settings or Active Directory integration.
2. **Expired Credentials**: Users might be using expired or incorrect login
   credentials.
3. **Network Communication Problems**: Issues with network connectivity
   preventing the Authentication Agent from reaching the Active Directory
   server.
4. **Active Directory Service Failure**: AD service interruptions or failures
   causing authentication validation problems.


#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **Check Agent Configuration**:

   * Verify that the Authentication Agent is configured correctly with the

     appropriate Active Directory connection settings.
   * Ensure that the Agent has the necessary permissions and access rights to

     communicate with the Active Directory server.

2. **Review Password Policies**:

   * Confirm that the password policies in Active Directory are set correctly

     and are not causing conflicts with the Authentication Agent's password
     validation process.

3. **Reset User Password**:

   * If the issue is with a specific user, try resetting their password in

     Active Directory and have them attempt to log in again using the new
     credentials.

4. **Restart Services**:

   * Restart the Authentication Agent and Active Directory services to ensure a

     fresh start and potential resolution of any temporary issues.

5. **Update Authentication Agent**:

   * Check for any updates or patches for the Authentication Agent software that

     may address known issues related to password validation.

6. **Monitor and Test**:
   * Continuously monitor the system and conduct test logins to check for any

     improvements or changes in the error status.


#### Additional Notes or Considerations:


* Collaborate with the IT team responsible for Active Directory management to

  investigate any potential AD service disruptions or configuration problems.

* Document all steps taken and log any relevant information for future reference

  or escalation if the issue persists.

* Consider seeking assistance from the vendor or support team of the

  Authentication Agent software for more in-depth troubleshooting assistance if
  needed.

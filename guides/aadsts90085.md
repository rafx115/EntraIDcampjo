# AADSTS90085: OrgIdWsFederationSltRedemptionFailed - The service is unable to issue a token because the company object hasn't been provisioned yet.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS90085

#### Error Description
**AADSTS90085** indicates that the service is unable to issue a token because the company object associated with the request hasnâ€™t been provisioned yet. This typically occurs during a federation or single sign-on (SSO) process where an organization has not been fully set up in Azure Active Directory (AAD).

### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps

**Check Error Context**
- Determine the context in which the error occurs. Is it during a login attempt, API call, or during SSO configuration?
- Note the exact time, application involved, and user identifiers.

**Review Azure AD Sign-in Logs**
- Navigate to Azure AD > Sign-ins in the Azure portal.
- Check for any sign-in failures and look for additional error codes or descriptions related to the failure.

**Verify Organizational Provisioning**
- Confirm that the organization exists in Azure AD.
- Check if the necessary attributes for the organization are configured correctly.

### 2. Common Issues that Cause This Error

- **Missing Organizational Entity**: The organization (company) associated with the login might not be provisioned in Azure AD.
- **Incorrect Federation Settings**: Misconfiguration in Federated Identity Providers (e.g., ADFS).
- **User Not Properly Assigned**: The specific user trying to authenticate may not be linked to a company or tenant.
- **Domain Verification Issues**: If the domain associated with the organization is not verified in Azure AD, it can lead to this error.
- **Intended Directory Missing**: The configuration expects requests to direct to a specific (but not provisioned) tenant or directory.

### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

#### Step 1: Verify Organization Existence
- **Azure Portal**: Check Azure AD to see if the organization exists.
- **PowerShell**: Use PowerShell commands to list tenants and domains, confirming the organization is present.

#### Step 2: Check Federation Settings
- If using ADFS for federation, ensure it is configured properly.
  - Verify AD FS claims rules and the relying party trust settings.
  - Ensure the right Endpoint URLs are in place.

#### Step 3: User and Domain Verification
- Confirm that users trying to authenticate are properly set up in Azure AD.
- Ensure any custom domains used are verified within Azure AD.

#### Step 4: Deployment of Directory Service
- If the organization is not provisioned, proceed with the provisioning process:
  - Navigate to Azure AD, and initiate the directory service provisioning.
  - Assign users or import users from on-premises Active Directory if applicable.

#### Step 5: Contact Microsoft Support
- If the issue persists after following the above steps, reach out to Microsoft support for more context as it may require deeper investigation.

### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Multi-Tenant Applications**: Ensure the application is correctly set up for multi-tenant scenarios if applicable.
- **Admin Privileges Required**: Ensure you have adequate permissions to view and modify Azure AD settings.
- **Check Latest Service Health**: Sometimes the issue can be related to a service outage with Azure services. Review Azure Service Health.

### 6. Advice for Data Collection

During troubleshooting, it may be helpful to gather logs and traces:

- **Event Viewer Logs**:
  - Check the Windows Event Viewer under Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > IdentityManagement for detailed logs related to identity issues.

- **Network Traces**:
  - Use tools like NetTrace or Wireshark to capture network traffic and identify any network-related issues.

- **Fiddler for HTTP Traces**:
  - Utilize Fiddler to capture HTTP/HTTPS traffic to see the flow of requests and responses during authentication.

- **Azure Diagnostics**:
  - Enable Azure Diagnostics in your relevant resource groups to capture more logs and metrics for further analysis.

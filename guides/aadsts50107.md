# AADSTS50107: InvalidRealmUri - The requested federation realm object doesn't exist. Contact the tenant admin.


## Troubleshooting Steps
The AADSTS50107 error, with the description "InvalidRealmUri - The requested federation realm object doesn't exist. Contact the tenant admin," indicates that the requested federation realm cannot be found in Azure Active Directory (AAD). This issue typically arises when a user attempts to authenticate against an incorrect or outdated federation configuration.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50107

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check the Realm URI**: 
   - Verify the realm URI that is being requested. Ensure it matches the expected value for your Azure AD tenant.

2. **Review Federation Configuration**:
   - If you are using ADFS or another federation service, confirm that the realm is correctly set up in the federation provider.

3. **Examine User Credential Usage**:
   - Identify which user accounts are experiencing the issue. Check if this is a widespread problem or isolated to specific users.

4. **Check the Directory**:
   - Use the Azure AD Admin Center to check if any recent changes were made to domains or federation settings.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **Misconfigured Federation Settings**:
   - The federation settings in Azure AD may be incorrect or out-of-date.

2. **Invalid or Deleted Federation Provider**:
   - The realm URI may be pointed to a federation provider that no longer exists or was never set up correctly.

3. **User's Identity Not Matching**:
   - The user requesting authentication may not belong to the expected realm, or their account could be associated with another tenant.

4. **DNS Issues**:
   - There might be DNS issues preventing the application from resolving the federation service endpoint correctly.

5. **Domain Verification Issues**:
   - The domain associated with the realm might not be verified in Azure AD.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify Federation Settings**:
   - Access the Azure AD portal and locate the federation settings. Ensure that the relying party (your application) is correctly listed.
   - `Sign in to Azure Portal -> Azure Active Directory -> App Registrations -> [Your App] -> Authentication -> Check Redirect URIs.`

2. **Check the Realm Configuration in ADFS**:
   - If using ADFS, open the ADFS Management console:
     - Navigate to **Relying Party Trusts**.
     - Confirm that your relying party (application) has the correct endpoints configured.
     - Verify that the **Identifier (Entity ID)** matches the realm URI you are using.

3. **Recreate the Federation**:
   - If you encounter significant misconfigurations, consider removing the current federation and recreating it.
   - Use PowerShell commands for Azure AD federation to help with this:
     ```powershell
     Set-MsolDomainAuthentication -DomainName "yourdomain.com" -Authentication Managed
     ```

4. **Adjust Application Settings**:
   - Ensure that any application using the realm is pointing to the correct endpoint with the correct realm URI.

5. **Check AAD for Status**:
   - Use the Azure Active Directory portal or Azure Service Health to check if there are any ongoing issues on Azureâ€™s side.

#### Additional Notes/Considerations

- Make sure all relevant users have been properly imported and exist in the Azure AD for authentication to be successful.
- Ensure your federation service certificates are valid and not expired.
- If changes have been made, give it time; sometimes, replication between services may cause short delays in changes being effective.

#### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - On the ADFS server, review the Event Viewer for any ADFS-related logs that correspond to the user's authentication attempts:
     - Look for logs under `Applications and Services Logs -> AD FS -> Admin` for any relevant warnings or errors.

2. **Network Tracing**:
   - Use `Nettrace` to capture network traffic during the authentication process, which may show where the requests are failing.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Utilize Fiddler to capture HTTP requests and responses. This can provide insight into the requests being sent and any potential errors overshadowed by AAD or the federation service.

By following the above guide, you can systematically identify and resolve issues related to the AADSTS50107 error in your federation setup and ensure proper authentication processing.

**Description:** The error code AADSTS50132, with the description

"SsoArtifactInvalidOrExpired - The session isn't valid due to password

expiration or recent password change," typically occurs when the user's session
is no longer valid due to password expiration or an update/change in the user's
password.


#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:

1. **Verify User Information:** Confirm if the user has recently changed their

   password or if the password has expired.
2. **User Reports:** Check if the user is experiencing any issues accessing

   other services with the same credentials.


#### Common Issues:

1. **Password Expiration:** Passwords have expiration policies that require

   regular changes. Users might forget to update the credentials in all
   services.
2. **Syncing Delays:** Sometimes, changes in passwords may not synchronize

   immediately across all systems.
3. **Incorrect Password Entry:** User might have forgotten the updated password

   or mistakenly entered the wrong password.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **User Confirmation:**    * Instruct the user to confirm if they recently 
changed their password or if

     their password has expired.

2. **Password Update:**    * Advise the user to update their password in the 
affected service following

     the password policy guidelines.

3. **Session Reset:** 

   * Have the user log out of the service, clear cache and cookies, then log in

     again with the updated password.

4. **System Sync:** 

   * If the issue persists, check for any delays in password syncing across

     systems. Manually sync if needed.

5. **Technical Support:**    * If the issue persists despite the above steps, 
escalate the problem to the

     IT or technical support team for further investigation.


#### Additional Notes or Considerations:


* **Password Policies:** Ensure users are aware of and compliant with password

  expiration and complexity policies.

* **User Training:** Provide guidance to users on managing password changes and

  updating credentials in all relevant services promptly.

* **System Notifications:** Enable system notifications for upcoming password

  expirations to help users proactively update their credentials.

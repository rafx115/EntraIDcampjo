#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Determine the Context of the Error**:
   - Identify the application or service that triggered the error.
   - Gather information about what the user was attempting to do when the error occurred.

2. **User Session Status**:
   - Check if the affected user is currently authenticated or if they are experiencing sign-in issues.
   - Verify if the user has recently changed their password.

3. **Review Current User Account Status**:
   - Check for password expiration notifications in the user's account.
   - Look for alerts in your Identity Provider (IdP) for any user sign-in issues.

#### Common Issues Causing This Error

1. **Password Change**:
   - The user's password was recently changed but they are still using the old password.

2. **Password Expiration**:
   - The user's password has expired, and they need to reset it.

3. **Session Timeout**:
   - The Single Sign-On (SSO) session has timed out due to inactivity.

4. **Cached Credentials**:
   - The application might be using cached tokens that are no longer valid after a password change.

5. **Token Expiration**:
   - The SSO artifact or token has expired and is not usable.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify User Credentials**:
   - Ask the user to confirm that they are using the correct username and password. If the password was recently changed, confirm they are using the new password.

2. **Reset Password**:
   - If the password has expired, instruct the user to reset their password through their organization’s password management system.

3. **Log Out and Log In Again**:
   - Instruct the user to log out completely from all sessions and then attempt to log back in with their current credentials.

4. **Clear Cache and Cookies**:
   - Advise the user to clear the browser cache and cookies or try accessing the application from a different browser or incognito mode.

5. **Session Renewal**:
   - If applicable, check if the application supports session renewal, and follow procedures to refresh the session.

6. **Check Application Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the application is properly configured to accept token updates or SSO sessions after password changes.

7. **Audit Logs**:
   - Review audit logs in your IdP to find any anomalies or issues related to authentication for the user.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: If your organization uses multi-factor authentication (MFA), ensure that the MFA setup is not the cause of additional issues during sign-in.
- **Token Lifetime**: Be aware of your organization’s policies regarding token lifetimes and refresh policies as they can impact SSO behavior.
- **User Education**: Provide users with training on password policy and the importance of logging out of applications after changing their password.

#### Advice for Data Collection

**For detailed troubleshooting, consider gathering the following logs and traces:**

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Capture relevant logs by accessing the Event Viewer on the server or system where the issue occurs. Look under "Windows Logs" > "Application" for authentication-related events.

2. **Network Traces**:
   - Use **NetTrace** (Network Tracing) to capture and analyze network traffic, especially for failed authentication requests.
   - Launch NetTrace and enable logging before reproducing the issue.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Use **Fiddler** to inspect HTTP traffic between the client and the server. Set it up to capture requests when attempting to authenticate.
   - Look for any responses from the Identity Provider that may provide more detail on the error.

**Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS76026: RequestIssueTimeExpired**

**Initial Diagnostic Steps**:

1. Verify the exact error message you are receiving and note down the error code
   AADSTS76026.
2. Review the logs or records to identify when the issue started occurring.
3. Ensure your system clock on the server or client is properly synchronized.
4. Check if there have been any recent changes to the authentication provider or
   configuration.
5. Confirm if the SAML authentication request contains the IssueTime attribute
   and compare it with the current time.

**Common Issues that Cause This Error**:

1. **Incorrect Time Configuration**: The IssueTime in the SAML2 Authentication
   Request might have been generated incorrectly or is not synchronized with the
   system time.
2. **Token Expiration**: The SAML request could be taking too long to process,
   causing the IssueTime to expire before authentication completes.
3. **Server Delays**: Slow server response times can lead to the expiration of
   the IssueTime before it is processed.

**Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies**:

1. **Correct the Time Configuration**:

   * Ensure that the system clocks on both the server and client sides are

     synchronized.
   * Check the IssueTime value in the SAML request and validate it against the

     system time.

2. **Adjust Token Expiration Settings**:

   * Review the SAML configuration settings to adjust the token expiration

     times, allowing for sufficient time to process the request.

3. **Optimize Server Performance**:

   * Identify any server performance issues that could be causing delays in

     processing the authentication requests.
   * Implement optimizations such as caching, load balancing, or upgrading

     server resources.

4. **Resend the SAML Request**:
   * If possible, resend the SAML request with a new IssueTime that takes into

     account the current time.

**Additional Notes or Considerations**:


* Double-check the SAML configuration and ensure that the IssueTime attribute is

  being set correctly.

* Monitor the system for any recurring occurrences of this error to identify

  underlying issues.

* Consider involving your IT team, system administrators, or external

  consultants for further assistance if needed.

By following these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to address the
error code AADSTS76026 related to the RequestIssueTimeExpired issue in the SAML2
Authentication Request effectively.

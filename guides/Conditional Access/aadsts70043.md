## Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS70043 Error Code

### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps
Before proceeding with specific resolutions, start by confirming the following:
- **Verify the Error Context**: When does this error occur? Are users experiencing it during sign-in, while using an application, or during background processing?
- **Check User Reports**: Collect data from affected users to determine if they are consistently facing the issue or if it is isolated to specific accounts or groups.
- **Determine Token Expiration Details**: Examine the `issueDate` and the `time` (maximum allowed lifetime) mentioned in the error message to understand how long the token was valid.

### 2. Common Issues that Cause this Error
- **Expired Refresh Tokens**: Refresh tokens have a limited lifespan, and if they are not refreshed in time, they become invalid.
- **Conditional Access Policy**: Conditional Access policies configured within Azure Active Directory may impose restrictions that limit session duration or require re-authentication for specific applications or devices.
- **Multiple Authentication Flows**: Applications that use multiple sign-in flows may inadvertently trigger sign-in frequency checks.

### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

**Step 1: Check Conditional Access Policies**
- Navigate to **Azure AD > Security > Conditional Access** in the Azure portal.
- Review policies that might apply to the affected users and their applications. Look especially for policies related to sign-in frequency, token lifetimes, or user location.

**Step 2: Review Token Lifespan Settings**
- Navigate to **Azure AD > Security > Authentication methods > Token lifetimes** to see the configured lifetimes for access and refresh tokens.
- If the token duration is too short for the intended application use case, consider adjusting this for affected users/groups.

**Step 3: Update Application Logic**
- If applicable, ensure that your application is correctly handling authentication refreshes per the defined token lifetimes.
- Implement checks that handle and gracefully respond to token expiration errors, which may include prompting users to re-authorize.

**Step 4: Educate Users**
- If the issue is frequent with specific user groups, provide guidance on sign-in procedures and the importance of staying active within applications to avoid token expiration.

**Step 5: Test User Sign-ins**
- Have affected users sign in again after confirming the adjustments to the conditional access policies or token lifetimes, or advise them to clear cached tokens in their browsers/apps.

### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Consider Sign-In Frequency Settings**: Depending on organizational requirements, it may be beneficial to adjust the sign-in frequency for specific users or groups based on their role or usage patterns.
- **Monitor Activity**: Utilize Azure AD's sign-in logs to monitor users experiencing this issue and identify patterns in usage or common factors leading to the error.

### 5. Documentation Where Steps Can Be Found
- For detailed guidance on managing Conditional Access policies, refer here: [Microsoft Documentation on Conditional Access Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview)
- For token lifetimes configuration, visit: [Configure token lifetimes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-configurable-token-lifetimes)

### 6. Test the Documentation can be Reachable
Ensure to check if the documentation links above are reachable by visiting them from a web browser. Here are the urls again:
- [Conditional Access Policy Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview)
- [Token Lifetimes Configuration Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-configurable-token-lifetimes)

### 7. Advice for Data Collection
- **User Feedback**: Gather detailed feedback from the users experiencing the issue, including when it occurs and the context of their actions.
- **Monitoring Logs**: Check Azure AD authentication logs for patterns that coincide with the error, which might offer insights into potential misconfigurations or policy issues.
- **Test Environments**: If possible, recreate the environment or scenarios that produce this error to observe behavior during authentication.

## Troubleshooting Steps
Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide for the AADSTS50012 error code, which indicates issues related to authentication failure. This guide covers initial diagnostics, common causes, resolution strategies, additional notes, and documentation references.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50012

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Read the Error Message Carefully**: The error message provides specific reasons for authentication failure related to signing certificates.
2. **Identify the Affected User/Service**: Determine which user or service principal is encountering the issue.
3. **Check the Azure AD Portal**: 
   - Go to the Azure Active Directory (AD) section in the Azure portal.
   - Check for any alerts regarding certificate issues or service principal identity problems.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error
1. **Invalid Certificate Thumbprint**: The certificate being used does not match one that’s configured in Azure AD.
2. **Expired Signing Certificate**: The signing certificate might be expired or invalid.
3. **Untrusted Certificate**: The subject name for the signing certificate isn’t recognized or trusted.
4. **Missing Policies**: Necessary authorization policies are not configured for the application.
5. **Misconfigured Application**: Settings for the application (App ID, tenant ID) may be incorrect, leading to authentication failures.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Check Certificate Validity**:
   - Verify that the certificate being used is within its valid date range (not expired).
   - Confirm that the signing certificate is correctly configured in Azure AD under the application’s certificate settings.
  
2. **Validate Certificate Thumbprint**:
   - Obtain the thumbprint of the signing certificate used in your application.
   - Navigate to the Azure portal and check the application registration.
   - Ensure that the thumbprint matches what is registered.

3. **Review Application Configuration**:
   - Re-verify the client ID and tenant ID for the application.
   - Make sure the correct API permissions are granted in the Azure portal.
   - Ensure that the application manifest is correctly outlined, especially the certificates and secrets section.

4. **Policy and Authority Settings**:
   - Check if any tenant policies are applied that may affect the authentication of the application.
   - Configure any necessary trusted authority or subject name policies under your tenant settings in Azure AD.

5. **Re-upload or Create New Certificates**:
   - If the existing certificate cannot be validated or is suspected to be faulty, consider generating a new certificate and uploading it to Azure AD.

6. **Logs and Monitoring**:
   - Check your application’s logs to see if any detailed exceptions are recorded during the authentication process.
   - Review Azure AD sign-in logs for further insights into the authentication failures.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Keep in mind that changes made to Azure AD (like certificate uploads) may take a few minutes to propagate.
- Ensure to verify **TLS** settings if involved in authentication flows, as mismatches can lead to connectivity issues.
- Consider any recent changes in your Azure AD configuration that might correlate with the onset of this issue.

#### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**:
  - Check Application and System logs for any related entries for errors and warnings around the application.
- **Network Tracing**:
  - Use **Nettrace** to capture API calls and see the responses from Azure AD during authentication processes.
- **Fiddler Tool**:
  - Monitor the network traffic with Fiddler to examine the request and response headers for any additional clues regarding the authentication failure.

By following the structured approach outlined in this guide, you should be able to identify and resolve the AADSTS50012 error, restoring successful authentication for your application or service principal.

## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS700023: InvalidResourcelessScope

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Review the Error Message**: Carefully read the error message provided by the system to understand the issue.
2. **Verify Input Parameters**: Check the input parameters being used, especially the scope parameter, to ensure they are correct and valid.

#### Common Issues:
- **Incorrect Scope Value**: Providing an invalid scope value in the input parameter can trigger this error.
- **Missing or Improperly Configured Resource**: If the requested resource or API permission is not properly configured in Azure Active Directory, it can result in this error.
- **Misconfigured App Registration**: Issues with the application registration settings in Azure AD can cause scope-related errors.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Check Application Registration**:
   - Go to Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > App Registrations and locate your app.
   - Ensure that the required permissions/scopes are properly configured for your application.

2. **Verify Scope Value**:
   - Check the scope value being passed in the request. Ensure it matches the expected scope values for the API/resource you are trying to access.

3. **Update Permissions**:
   - If the scope value is incorrect, update the permissions in the Azure portal to include the necessary scopes.
   - Make sure the requested scopes align with the application's configuration and API/resource requirements.

4. **Reauthenticate**:
   - Try reauthenticating the user or application to fetch a new token with the correct scope.
   
#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- The error indicates a mismatch between the requested scope and the expected scope for the resource. Ensure they align correctly.
- Verify the configurations of both the application and the resource/API in Azure AD to ensure consistency.

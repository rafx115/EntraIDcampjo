## Troubleshooting Steps

Here is a detailed troubleshooting guide for the AADSTS700023 error code with
the description InvalidResourcelessScope.


### Initial Diagnostic Steps:

1. **Confirm the Scenario**: Understand the context in which the error occurs,
   such as the application or service making the request and the scope being
   used.
2. **Check Request Parameters**: Review the parameters being sent in the
   request, focusing on the scope parameter that triggered the error.
3. **Review Azure AD Configuration**: Check the Azure AD application
   configuration, permissions, and scopes to ensure they align with the request.


### Common Issues:

1. **Incorrect Scope Format**: The scope parameter may be incorrectly formatted
   or missing required scopes.
2. **Misconfigured Application Permission**: The Azure AD application may not
   have the correct permissions or scopes configured.
3. **Changed Permissions**: If permissions or scopes were recently updated,
   there may be a mismatch causing the error.


### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **Verify Scope Parameter**:
   * Ensure the scope parameter in the request is correctly formatted and

     contains valid values. Refer to Azure AD documentation for the correct
     scope format.
2. **Check Application Permissions**:
   * Review the application's permissions and scopes in Azure AD.

   * Make sure the requested scope is defined in the application's registration

     manifest or API permissions.
3. **Update Application Configuration**:
   * If the scope is missing or incorrect, update the Azure AD application

     configuration to include the necessary scopes.
4. **Revoke and Reauthorize**:
   * Revoke the consent given to the application and reauthorize it. This can

     help in resetting any misconfigurations.
5. **Testing and Logs**:
   * Run test requests with different scopes to pinpoint the exact scope causing

     the error.
   * Check logs in Azure AD to gather more information on the error and pinpoint

     the root cause.


### Additional Notes or Considerations:


* **Scope Hierarchy**: Ensure the scopes being requested by the application

  align with the application's permissions and consent flow.

* **API Permissions**: Make sure the APIs being accessed require the requested

  scopes and permissions to avoid the error.

* **Third-Party Libraries**: If using third-party libraries, ensure they are

  sending the correct scope parameters in the authentication flow.

By following these steps and considering the common issues, you should be able

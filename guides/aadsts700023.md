# AADSTS700023: InvalidResourcelessScope - The provided value for the input parameter scope isn't valid when requesting an access token.


## Troubleshooting Steps
## Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS700023: InvalidResourcelessScope Error

### Overview
The error code AADSTS700023 with the description “InvalidResourcelessScope” indicates that the scope parameter provided during the OAuth2 authentication request is invalid for acquiring an access token. This often occurs when requesting tokens for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) resources.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check the Error Message**: Review the entire error message for context. It may include additional details that can help identify the issue.
2. **Confirm OAuth2 Configuration**: Verify that your application is set up correctly in the Azure portal.
3. **Review Authorization Request**:
   - Inspect the request being sent to Azure AD, especially the scope parameter.
   - Ensure that the scope is properly formatted.

### Common Issues Causing the Error

1. **Incorrect Scope Format**: The scope must be a space-separated list of permission scopes. Make sure to use the right format.
2. **Invalid Resource**: The specified resource in the scope does not exist or is inaccessible. Confirm the resource ID is correct.
3. **No Resource Specified**: If attempting to request an access token without specifying a resource, Azure AD may not be able to establish the correct context.
4. **Application Permissions**: The application permissions might not cover the requested scopes. Check if the scopes are consented in the Azure portal.
5. **API Permissions**: Ensure that the API you're trying to access has its permissions set correctly for the application.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify Scope Values**:
   - Go to the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to the App registrations and find your application.
   - Under "API permissions", verify that the requested scopes are listed and properly consented.

2. **Correct Formatting of the Scope Parameter**:
   - The scope parameter should follow this format: 
     ```
     https://{resource}/.default 
     ```
     or 
     ```
     https://{resource}/scope1 scope2
     ```
   - Ensure there's no unintended leading or trailing whitespace.

3. **Specify an Appropriate Resource**:
   - If sending a request without specifying a resource, include the correct resource URL.
   - Example:
     ```html
     POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

     grant_type=authorization_code
     &client_id={client_id}
     &client_secret={client_secret}
     &scope=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2F.default
     ```

4. **Check Permissions**:
   - Revisit the "API permissions" section to ensure your application has permissions for all requested scopes.
   - If necessary, add permissions or request admin consent.

5. **Check Azure AD Policies**:
   - Ensure that no restrictions (such as Conditional Access policies) are blocking the request.

6. **Utilize Azure AD Request Analyzer**:
   - Use tools like the Azure AD Token Reference or Microsoft Graph Explorer to validate the format and existence of the requested scopes.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- The error must often be resolved by ensuring that the scope being requested directly correlates to an API for which the application has permissions. 
- It is crucial that the scopes must be properly formatted and referenced according to Azure's requirements.

### Advice for Data Collection

Before escalating the issue or seeking external help, gather the following data:

1. **Request and Response Logs**: Capture the request made to Azure AD, including headers, body, and response.
2. **Application ID and Tenant ID**: Ensure to note the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID for reference in support tickets.
3. **Error Code and Message**: Include the complete error code (AADSTS700023) and message in any support requests.
4. **Configuration Details**: Document the configuration settings in Azure AD for the application, including permissions setup.

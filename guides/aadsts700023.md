# AADSTS700023: InvalidResourcelessScope - The provided value for the input parameter scope isn't valid when requesting an access token.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS700023

The AADSTS700023 error is associated with Azure Active Directory and indicates that the "scope" parameter provided in the access token request is not valid. To resolve this issue, follow these diagnostic steps and resolutions.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Verify the Error Message**: Confirm that the error message matches exactly as described (InvalidResourcelessScope). Sometimes, other errors may be misidentified.

2. **Check the Request URL**: Review the request URL being used to obtain the access token. Ensure it is correct and follows the format required by Azure AD.

3. **Identify the Client Application**: Determine which application is generating the error. Is it a web application, mobile application, or service?

4. **Assess the Scope Parameter**: Confirm the scope (e.g., `offline_access`, `openid`, `profile`, etc.) being requested. 

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **Invalid or Unrecognized Scope**: The provided scope may not be recognized by Azure AD, especially if it's incorrectly formatted or not valid for the resource.

2. **Empty or Missing Scope**: If no scope is provided or explicitly defined as an empty string, this error can occur.

3. **Resource/Client Mismatch**: The scope requested may be invalid for the resource or application ID specified in the request.

4. **API Permissions Not Granted**: The application may not have been given the required permissions in the Azure portal to access the requested scope.

5. **Token Acquisition Endpoint Issues**: The token acquisition endpoint being used (authorization code, client credentials, etc.) may be mismatched with the scopes.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify Scope Values**:
   - Check the application registration in the Azure portal under "API permissions".
   - Make sure the scopes requested match those defined for your application.

2. **Request Correct Scopes**:
   - Update the application code to ensure the requested scopes are valid.
   - Examples of valid scopes include:
     - `https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read`
     - `api://{client_id}/.default`
   - Ensure scopes are space-separated in the request.

3. **Ensure Permissions are Granted**:
   - Go to Azure Active Directory > App registrations > Your Application > API permissions.
   - Ensure the relevant API permissions are granted and that admin consent has been given if required.

4. **Check Application Registration and Authentication Settings**:
   - Validate that the application is correctly registered without any configuration errors.
   - Go to "Authentication" and ensure the redirect URIs and implicit grant settings (if applicable) are configured correctly.

5. **Update Cache or Tokens**:
   - If changes are made, clear any caches or refresh tokens being used.

6. **Testing via Postman**: 
   - Test the token request using tools like Postman.
   - This helps isolate whether the issue is in the application code or in the configuration.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Rate Limit Issues**: If there are many requests being made to obtain tokens, ensure you are not hitting any Azure AD throttling limits.
- **Multi-Tenant Applications**: If your application is multi-tenant, ensure that scopes are applicable for all tenants or explicitly handle permissions.

#### Documentation References

- [Microsoft Documentation on Azure AD Error Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aad-error-codes)
- [Azure AD Authentication Scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)

#### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Check the Application event logs for any issues related to authentication failures that may provide more context.

2. **Network Trace**: 
   - Use the command-line tool `netsh trace start capture` (for Windows) to gather network traces if you suspect network-related issues.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Use Fiddler to inspect the HTTP request/response exchange around your access token request. Look closely at the scopes being sent.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve issues related to the AADSTS700023 error, while ensuring a well-structured approach to troubleshooting.

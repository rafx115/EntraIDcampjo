# AADSTS70000: InvalidGrant - Authentication failed. The refresh token isn't valid. Error might be due to the following reasons:Token binding header is emptyToken binding hash does not match


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Here’s a comprehensive troubleshooting guide for the AADSTS70000 error with the description "InvalidGrant - Authentication failed. The refresh token isn't valid." 

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS70000 Error 

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check the Application’s Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the application is correctly registered in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
   - Verify that the correct `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, `Redirect URI`, and any required permissions are correctly configured.

2. **Review Token Expiry:**
   - Check if the refresh token has expired. Refresh tokens usually have a limited lifetime.
   - Verify if the refresh token has been revoked or invalidated by user action or changes in security settings.

3. **Examine the Token Binding:**
   - Given the error mentions token binding, check to see if the token binding header is being sent with requests.
   - Verify if token binding is enabled for the application and if it's being enforced correctly.

4. **Check User Account Status:**
   - Ensure that the user account is not disabled, deleted, or locked out.

5. **Inspect Application Logs:**
   - Look at the logs generated by your application. These might provide context around the failure.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Expired or Revoked Refresh Tokens:**
   - Refresh tokens can expire or be revoked based on user actions or policies.

2. **Null or Improper Token Binding Headers:**
   - The absence of proper token binding or formats may cause the authentication to fail.

3. **User Account Changes:**
   - Changes to user account status, such as disabling the account, can invalidate tokens.

4. **Configuration Changes:**
   - Modifications in Azure AD app registration settings can lead to invalidation of tokens.

5. **Connection Issues:**
   - Issues with internet connectivity or Azure service disruptions might also affect token validation.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Renew Refresh Tokens:**
   - Implement a flow to re-authenticate the user and obtain new refresh tokens if current ones are invalid.

2. **Handle Token Binding:**
   - If your application is supposed to use token binding, ensure that the appropriate headers are sent in your requests.
   - Ensure that your application is configured to correctly support or not enforce token binding based on your scenario.

3. **Confirm Token Validity:**
   - Use tools like [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/) to inspect the JWT (if applicable). Ensure the tokens are not altered and have the right claims.

4. **Recheck Application Permissions:**
   - Validate the application permissions in Azure AD and ensure that they align with what your application needs.

5. **User Sign-In Flow:**
   - If the refresh token is invalid, instruct the user to sign in again to create a new authentication session.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Ensure your application handles the `InvalidGrant` error gracefully by prompting the user to re-authenticate when needed.
- Be cautious with scope permissions; requesting unnecessary permissions can lead to user consent issues and token problems.
- Familiarize yourself with Azure AD's token lifecycle management policies.

#### Documentation and Guidance

You can find detailed guidance in the following resources:

- [Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-authentication-libraries)
- [Access tokens, refresh tokens, and ID tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens)
- [Managing refresh tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols-oidc#refreshing-access-tokens)
- [Debugging OAuth Authentication Issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-web-app-configuration)

#### Advice for Data Collection

If you need more data to diagnose the problem:

1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - Check the application logs in the Event Viewer on the server where the application is running. Look for entries related to authentication failures.

2. **Network Tracing:**
   - Use tools like [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) or [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) to capture network traffic. This will allow you to inspect the actual requests and responses sent to Azure AD.

3. **.NET Tracing:**
   - If your application is a .NET application, you can enable tracing and log the authentication process details to help find out where it fails.

Collecting this data will give you better insight into what might be causing the `AADSTS70000` error and will help in diagnosing whether it's a configuration issue, a network issue, or something related to the Azure AD service itself.

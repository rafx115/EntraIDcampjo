# AADSTS70000: InvalidGrant - Authentication failed. The refresh token isn't valid. Error might be due to the following reasons:Token binding header is emptyToken binding hash does not match


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Error Code: AADSTS70000 - InvalidGrant - Authentication failed. The refresh token isn't valid.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Verify Token Binding Header**: Check if the token binding header is empty.
2. **Check Token Binding Hash**: Ensure that the token binding hash matches.
3. **Review Integration**: Examine the resource or service integration where the error occurred.
4. **Confirm Refresh Token Validity**: Check the validity of the refresh token being used.

#### Common Issues:
1. **Empty Token Binding Header**: If the token binding header is missing, authentication fails.
2. **Mismatch in Token Binding Hash**: If the token binding hash does not match, authentication fails.
3. **Expired Refresh Token**: The refresh token may have expired or been revoked, leading to authentication failure.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Review Token Binding Settings**:
   - Ensure that the token binding is correctly set up in the application or service making the authentication request.
   - Verify if the token binding header is being included in the request.

2. **Check Token Binding Hash**:
   - If the hash does not match, confirm that the hashing algorithm and parameters are consistent between requests.

3. **Refresh Token Verification**:
   - Obtain a new valid refresh token from the authorization server if the current one is expired or invalid.
   - Check for any policy or configuration updates that may affect the refresh token validity.

4. **Monitor Logs and Debug**:
   - Review authentication logs to identify any specific error messages or patterns that can help pinpoint the issue.
   - Utilize debugging tools or APIs to track the flow of authentication and token validation processes.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- **Token Lifetime**: Understand the token expiration policy and ensure that refresh tokens are used within their validity period.
- **Token Security**: Protect refresh tokens as sensitive data and follow best practices for secure token handling.

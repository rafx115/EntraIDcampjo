### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **User Verification:**
   - Confirm which user account is experiencing the issue.
   - Check if the user is logging in with the correct credentials.

2. **Network Connectivity Check:**
   - Ensure that the userâ€™s machine is properly connected to the corporate network or VPN if remote.

3. **Browser/Session Check:**
   - Ask the user to clear their browser cache and cookies, then attempt to log in again. 
   - Suggest trying a different web browser or an incognito/private window.

4. **Review Active Directory Configuration:**
   - Check if the user account is correctly set up in Active Directory.
   - Validate if the user is part of the required security groups for the application.

### Common Issues Leading to AADSTS51006

1. **Session Token Issues:**
   - Users may have stale or expired session tokens that do not include the required IWA claim.

2. **Browser Configuration:**
   - Certain browser settings might block IWA, affecting the login process.

3. **Network Conditions:**
   - Issues with network configurations or firewalls may hinder IWA checks.

4. **Conditional Access Policies:**
   - Azure AD has specific policies requiring IWA, which could apply to certain groups or users.

5. **User Domain Issues:**
   - The user may be attempting to access the application from a non-domain-joined device.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Force Reauthentication:**
   - Instruct the user to log out of all sessions completely and log back in. This will generate a new session token with the necessary claims.

2. **Browser Setup:**
   - For Internet Explorer or Edge:
     - Go to Internet Options -> Security -> Local Intranet -> Sites -> Advanced.
     - Add the application URL to the trusted sites.
     - Ensure "Automatic logon only in Intranet zone" is selected.
   - For Chrome:
     - Similar settings may need to be applied in policy settings, or users can be directed to use the native browser settings.

3. **Verify Network Login Status:**
   - Ensure that the machine is connected to the corporate network or VPN and is domain authenticated.

4. **Review Azure AD Conditional Access Policies:**
   - Review and modify any conditional access policies impacting the user. The policies sometimes require specific authentication methods.

5. **App Registration Review:**
   - Ensure that the application is correctly registered in Azure AD, and all necessary permissions are granted.

6. **User Domain Compliance:**
   - Validate whether the user is trying to access the application from a non-domain-joined device. If they are, consider instructing the user to log in from a domain-joined device.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- It's essential to maintain up-to-date IWA configurations and user domain settings to prevent this issue.
- Encourage users to report any irregularities in their login process consistently.
- Remind users about the importance of keeping their devices and browsers updated to the latest versions.

### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - Check the Application and System logs in the Event Viewer on the user's machine for any related authentication errors.

2. **Network Tracer (NetTrace):**
   - Use NetTrace tool to capture network packets during the login attempt to view any failure in IWA or token claims.

3. **Fiddler:**
   - Capture HTTP traffic with Fiddler to analyze request and response headers, thereby identifying if the IWA claims are being requested properly or getting blocked.

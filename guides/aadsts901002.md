## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Here's a detailed troubleshooting guide for the error code AADSTS901002, including steps for diagnostics, common causes, resolution strategies, additional considerations, documentation references, and advice for data collection.

### Error Details:
**Error Code**: AADSTS901002  
**Description**: "AADSTS901002: The 'resource' request parameter isn't supported."  

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Identify the Context**: Gather information about the scenario when the error occurs. Is it during user sign-in, application access, or API calls?
2. **Check the Application**: Determine if the error occurs consistently or intermittently. Identify the client application (e.g., a web app, a mobile app) involved.
3. **Verify Request Details**: Examine the authentication request. Look for any incorrect parameters being sent to Azure AD.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error:
1. **Unsupported Request Parameters**: The application might be sending a `resource` parameter that is not needed for the current flow (e.g., implicit flow).
2. **Misconfiguration in Azure AD**: The application might be misconfigured in Azure AD, such as incorrect permissions or endpoint settings.
3. **Endpoint Deprecated**: Using an outdated endpoint or API version that no longer supports the `resource` parameter.
4. **OAuth2 Flow Mismatch**: Using the wrong OAuth2 flow (e.g., trying to use the authorization code flow with the resource parameter).

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Review Application Configuration**:
   - Go to Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > App registrations.
   - Select your application, and verify its authentication settings.
   - Ensure that the redirect URIs and permissions are correctly defined.

2. **Modify Authentication Parameters**:
   - If using the OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow, remove the `resource` parameter from the request.
   - For the OAuth2 Authorization Code and OAuth2 Client Credentials flows, ensure the correct audience is set in the `scope` parameter.

3. **Inspect the Token Request**:
   - Ensure that the request format adheres to the OAuth2 specification being used.
   - For access tokens, use the `scope` parameter instead of `resource` in the request.

4. **Use a Supported Flow**:
   - Ensure that your application is using the correct flow (e.g. Authorization Code Flow, Implicit Flow, Client Credentials Flow) as per the design of the application.

5. **Update the SDK/Library**:
   - If you are using an older version of an authentication library (like MSAL), consider updating it to the latest version that conforms with the OAuth2 specifications.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- Always ensure that your app has permissions for the requested resources.
- Sometimes external libraries handle parameters in their internal mechanisms, so checking documentation for those libraries is crucial.
- Review the Azure Active Directory logs for any additional insights.

#### Documentation for Guidance:
- Microsoft Docs on [Azure Active Directory Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios).
- OAuth2 and OpenID Connect documentation at [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) and [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/).
- [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview).

#### Advice for Data Collection:
- **Event Viewer**: Check the application and system logs in Windows Event Viewer for any errors related to authentication or connectivity.
- **NetTrace**: Use tools like NetMon or Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic when making authentication requests.
- **Fiddler**: Use Fiddler to inspect the HTTP requests and responses, focusing on the parameters being sent to Azure AD. Look for any discrepancies in the request body.

### Conclusion:
Following these troubleshooting steps should help identify and resolve the AADSTS901002 error. Always validate the request being made and ensure that your application adheres to the latest Azure AD and OAuth2 guidelines.

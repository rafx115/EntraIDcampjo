# AADSTS700082: ExpiredOrRevokedGrantInactiveToken - The refresh token has expired due to inactivity. The token was issued on {issueDate} and was inactive for {time}. Expected part of the token lifecycle - the user went an extended period of time without using the application, so the token was expired when the app attempted to refresh it.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS700082

The error code AADSTS700082 indicates that a refresh token has expired or was revoked due to inactivity. This typically happens when a user has not used the application for an extended period, leading to the expiration of the token that allows for seamless re-authentication without user intervention.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify the Context**: Determine which application or service is producing the error. Is it an internal application, a third-party application, or Azure AD related?
2. **Check User Activity**: Verify if the user has been using the application recently. If there has been a long period of inactivity (usually around 90 days), this could be indicative of the problem.
3. **Review Application Logs**: Look at the application’s authentication logs for errors just before the AADSTS700082 error to get more context on the user’s last activity and token requests.
4. **User History and Permissions**: Check if the affected user has a history of activity related to the specific application. Is this user subject to conditional access policies that might affect their login?
5. **Token Lifetimes and Policies**: Understand and check the token lifetime policies configured in Azure AD, especially the settings regarding refresh tokens.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error
- **Token Expiration**: Refresh tokens may expire after a set period of inactivity (e.g., 90 days). If the user doesn't interact with the app during this period, the refresh token will become invalid.
- **User Revocation**: The user may manually revoke consent for the application in the Azure AD settings, invalidating all existing tokens.
- **Application Configuration**: Misconfiguration of the application in Azure AD, particularly regarding permissions and token lifetimes.
- **Conditional Access Policies**: Policies that restrict token issuance or require re-authentication based on certain conditions (like location, device state, etc.).

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **User Re-authentication**:
   - Ask the user to sign out and sign back into the application. This will issue a new refresh token if their credentials are still valid.
  
2. **Check Token Lifetimes**:
   - Use the Azure portal to review and potentially adjust the token lifetime policies as needed.
   - Consider increasing refresh token lifetime settings or modifying inactivity thresholds if appropriate for your organization.

3. **Consult Logs**:
   - Review Azure AD sign-in logs for any indications related to the expiration and activity leading up to the error.
   - Look for failed sign-in attempts or unusual patterns that might shed light on the issue.

4. **Assess Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Review any existing conditional access policies that may affect the user or application. Adjust policies as necessary based on user roles.

5. **User Consent**:
   - Instruct the user to check their account settings in Azure AD and ensure that the application has the necessary permissions. Re-consent may be required.

6. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Provide users with feedback regarding best practices to prevent token expiration, such as regular logins or interactions with the application.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Inform users about the length of inactivity that leads to token expiration and recommend practices to avoid this (e.g., regular logins).
- Monitor user activity and token utilization, especially for applications that are not frequently used.
- Be aware of compliance requirements that might necessitate regular password changes, potentially leading to additional activations of this error.

#### Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer, NetTrace, Fiddler)
- **Event Viewer**: Check if there are any logs related to the application and Azure AD authentication errors in the Windows Event Viewer on the client machine.
- **NetTrace**: Use NetTrace to capture network activity during the authentication process to identify where the failure occurs.
- **Fiddler**: Use Fiddler to monitor HTTP requests and responses, especially looking at the tokens sent to and received from Azure AD to help diagnose authorization issues.

# AADSTS700082: ExpiredOrRevokedGrantInactiveToken - The refresh token has expired due to inactivity. The token was issued on {issueDate} and was inactive for {time}. Expected part of the token lifecycle - the user went an extended period of time without using the application, so the token was expired when the app attempted to refresh it.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS700082 - ExpiredOrRevokedGrantInactiveToken

Error Code: **AADSTS700082**  
Description: **ExpiredOrRevokedGrantInactiveToken** - This error indicates that the refresh token has expired due to inactivity. The token was issued on {issueDate} and has not been used for {time}.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check Application Logs:**
   - Review the logs of the application that encountered the error. Look for previous authentication attempts and the time of the last successful token acquisition.
   
2. **Obtain Exact Error Message:**
   - Ensure you capture the complete error message including the issue date and the inactivity duration.

3. **User Activity Verification:**
   - Verify if the user had been actively using the application. Identify the timeframe of inactivity that led to the token's expiration.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Inactivity Period:**
   - The user has not interacted with the application for a duration that exceeds the refresh token's lifespan as defined in the policy settings.

2. **Token Lifetime Policies:**
   - Custom token lifetime policies may have been set within Azure AD that determine how long refresh tokens remain valid.

3. **Application Reconfiguration:**
   - Recent changes to the application settings in Azure AD, such as redirect URIs or permissions, could result in refresh token errors.

4. **Time Synchronization Issues:**
   - Inaccurate system clocks between the client application and Azure AD could create problems with token validity.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Notify the User:**
   - Inform the user that their token has expired and recommend they sign in again.

2. **Implement Silent Authentication:**
   - If appropriate, implement silent authentication strategies (e.g., using iframes or hidden frames) to re-authenticate the user without requiring them to enter credentials.

3. **Modify Token Lifetimes (If Applicable):**
   - Review the token lifetime settings in Azure AD. If necessary, adjust the settings based on user activity patterns. Refer to Azure AD documentation on how to configure token lifetimes.
   - **Documentation:** [Configure the lifetime of Azure AD tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-configurable-token-lifetimes)

4. **User Interface Improvements:**
   - Implement user interface prompts or notifications to remind users to interact with the application periodically to prevent token expiration.

5. **Monitor User Activity:**
   - Set up logging and monitoring to observe user activity patterns and detect potential inactivity that could lead to token expiration.

6. **Educate Users:**
   - Provide guidance on how to best use the application to maintain session activity.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Token Refresh Logic:**
   - Ensure that the application's token refresh logic is correctly implemented and that it handles cases of expired tokens gracefully.
- **User Education:**
   - Educate users on limits regarding expected interaction frequency with the application to keep their sessions active.
- **Testing:**
   - Test changes in a controlled environment before deploying widely, especially if changing token lifetime settings.

- Consider bookmarking the links for future reference.

#### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Log Information:**
   - Collect logs at the time of the error and the request/response details for token acquisition attempts.
   
2. **Capture User Interactions:**
   - Gather data on how often users are accessing the application and any common patterns leading to the inactivity.

3. **Error Reporting:**
   - Implement error reporting within the app to send notifications back to your logging infrastructure whenever this error occurs.

Following these steps should assist in diagnosing and resolving the AADSTS700082 error effectively while understanding the broader implications of token management in your application.

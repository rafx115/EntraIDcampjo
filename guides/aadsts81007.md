## Troubleshooting Steps
**Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS81007: "DesktopSsoTenantIsNotOptIn" Error**

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Understand the Error**:
   - The error `AADSTS81007` indicates that the Azure AD tenant you are trying to use does not have Seamless Single Sign-On (Seamless SSO) enabled.

2. **Verify Tenant Configuration**:
   - Confirm that you have access to the Azure AD tenant settings.
   - Make sure you have the necessary permissions to view and change the settings (`Global Administrator` or `Privileged Role Administrator`).

3. **Check User Context**:
   - Ensure that you are trying to perform the authentication with a user account that is from the tenant in question.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Seamless SSO Not Enabled**:
   - The most common cause is that Seamless SSO is not configured for the Azure AD tenant.

2. **Incorrect Tenant Information**:
   - The client application may be pointing to a different or incorrect tenant where Seamless SSO is not enabled.

3. **Policy Restrictions**:
   - There may be conditional access policies that affect the user's ability to log in.

4. **Updates in Azure AD Configuration**:
   - Recent changes in Azure AD settings might have inadvertently disabled Seamless SSO.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Enabling Seamless SSO**:
   - Log in to the Azure portal with the necessary admin rights.
   - Navigate to Azure Active Directory > Enterprise applications > All applications.
   - Locate the application for which you want to enable Seamless SSO.
   - Under the application settings, select "Single sign-on" and choose "Seamless SSO".
   - Follow the prompts to enable this option.

2. **Verify Domain Join Requirements**:
   - Ensure that your Windows 10/11 devices are domain-joined to the same domain as your Azure AD tenant.
   - Verify that these devices can communicate with the Azure AD.

3. **Check Azure AD Connect**:
   - If you are using Azure AD Connect, make sure it is configured correctly.
   - Confirm that the Azure AD Connect server is set up to allow Seamless SSO.
   - Re-run the Azure AD Connect wizard to check the Seamless SSO configuration.

4. **Review Service Principal**:
   - Ensure that the application service principal exists in your tenant.
   - Consult the Azure AD documentation to see if there are any specific requirements for the service principal.

5. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Use a different user account in the same tenant to confirm if the issue is user-specific or tenant-wide.
   - After making changes, perform a test sign-in to verify whether or not the issue is resolved.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **User Permissions**: Ensure that all users trying to authenticate have the proper licenses assigned.
- **Global Administrator Role**: Only users with global admin roles can enable or manage Seamless SSO settings.
- **Network Considerations**: Verify that there are no network-related issues that could affect the connection to Azure AD.

### Advice for Data Collection

If you need to collect data related to the issue, consider gathering the following:

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Check the Windows Event Viewer for logs related to Azure AD or authentication errors. Look under **Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > AzureAD**.

2. **Network Traces**:
   - Use **NetTrace** to capture network traffic that can help identify connectivity issues between your device and Azure services.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Consider using **Fiddler** to trace HTTP/HTTPS requests made by your application during the sign-in process. This can help uncover underlying communication errors.

By carefully following the outlined troubleshooting steps and recommendations, you should be able to address and resolve the AADSTS81007 error effectively. If the problem persists, consider reaching out to Microsoft Support for further assistance.

# AADSTS40008: OAuth2IdPUnretryableServerError - There's an issue with your federated Identity Provider. Contact your IDP to resolve this issue.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Troubleshooting the AADSTS40008 error, which indicates an issue with a federated Identity Provider (IdP), requires a systematic approach. Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide to help diagnose and resolve the error.

### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps

#### Step 1: Identify the Context
- Determine when and where the error occurs (e.g., during login, token acquisition).
- Note the specific actions or events leading up to the error.

#### Step 2: Check User Details
- Verify if the error occurs for all users or specific users.
- Collect usernames and roles of affected users.

#### Step 3: Review Error Message
- Capture the full error message including `AADSTS40008` and any additional diagnostic information provided.

### 2. Common Issues that Cause AADSTS40008

- **IdP Configuration Errors**: Misconfiguration of the federated IdP settings in Azure Active Directory (AAD).
- **Network Issues**: Network connectivity problems between AAD and the Identity Provider.
- **Expired Certificates**: If your IdP uses certificates for signing, expired or invalid certificates can lead to this issue.
- **Service Outages**: Temporary outages or maintenance on the IdP can cause authentication failures.
- **Metadata Changes**: Any recent changes in the IdP metadata that have not been updated in AAD.
- **Clock Skew**: Significant differences in the system time between the IdP and AAD.

### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

#### Step 1: Validate IdP Configuration
- Log into the Azure portal and navigate to `Azure Active Directory`.
- Check the `Enterprise applications` section.
- Select the application that's facing issues and review the `Single sign-on` configuration:
  - Ensure URLs (SAML Sign-on URL, Identifier, etc.) are correct.
  
#### Step 2: Confirm IdP Status
- Contact your Identity Provider support or check their status page to verify if there are outages or issues.

#### Step 3: Review Certificates
- If your IdP uses certificates, ensure that they are valid and not expired.
- In Azure, check the `Certificates & secrets` section for active keys and certificates.

#### Step 4: Update IdP Metadata
- If there are changes in the IdP configuration, update the Federated metadata URL in Azure AD.
- Ensure all necessary claims are being sent by the IdP to Azure.

#### Step 5: Check for Clock Skew
- Ensure that the clocks on the AAD server and the IdP server are synchronized.
- Use NTP (Network Time Protocol) service if possible.

#### Step 6: Test Authentication Flow
- Attempt to re-authenticate the user after applying changes to ensure that the issue is resolved.

### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations

- Keep user communication available and notify them of ongoing issues.
- Document any changes made during the troubleshooting process for future reference.
- Consider rolling back recent updates if they coincide with the emergence of this error.
  
### 5. Documentation for Guidance

While troubleshooting, refer to the following Microsoft documentation for further guidance:
- [Azure AD troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/troubleshoot-azure-ad-issues)
- [Integrate with a SAML-based Identity Provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/single-and-multi-tenant-apps)
- [Configure SAML authentication for Single Sign-On](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-authenticate-saml)

### 6. Test Documentation Accessibility

It’s important to ensure that the links to the above documentation are reachable:
- Visit each link in a web browser to confirm that the pages are live and the information is current.

### 7. Advice for Data Collection

- **Logs**: Collect logs from both Azure Active Directory and the IdP to understand the path of authentication.
- **User Feedback**: Ask affected users to describe their experiences and steps taken during the authentication process.
- **System Configuration**: Keep a record of IdP configuration settings and any recent changes.
- **Time Check**: Consider capturing the current time from both Azure and IdP systems if clock skew is suspected.

By following this guide, you can systematically diagnose, troubleshoot, and resolve the AADSTS40008 error and improve your understanding of the federated authentication setup with Azure Active Directory and your Identity Provider.

# AADSTS700084: The refresh token was issued to a single page app (SPA), and therefore has a fixed, limited lifetime of {time}, which can't be extended. It is now expired and a new sign in request must be sent by the SPA to the sign in page. The token was issued on {issueDate}.


## Troubleshooting Steps
## Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS700084

### Description:
The error code AADSTS700084 indicates that a refresh token issued to a Single Page Application (SPA) has expired. This refresh token has a fixed, limited lifetime and cannot be renewed. The application must initiate a new sign-in process to obtain a new refresh token.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Verify Error Message Details**:
   - Confirm that the error message specifically indicates the refresh token is expired and provides the `issueDate`.

2. **Confirm Application Type**:
   - Ensure you're dealing with a Single Page Application (SPA) since the error is specific to SPAs and their token management.

3. **Check Token Expiry Time**:
   - Record the token's expiration time provided in the error message and compare it to the current time to confirm its expiry.

### Common Issues that Cause this Error
1. **Misconfiguration of Token Lifetime Policies**: 
   - Token lifetime settings in Azure AD may be configured in a way that causes the refresh token to expire sooner than expected.

2. **Application Logic Issues**:
   - The application may fail to handle token refresh correctly and rely on expired tokens.

3. **User Inactivity**:
   - The refresh token may expire due to user inactivity or prolonged session duration affecting the SaaS service.

4. **Multiple Applications**:
   - Multiple SPAs or applications attempting to use the same refresh token could lead to conflicts or unexpected expirations.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Initiate New Sign-In Flow**:
   - Direct the user to the sign-in page to authenticate and obtain a new access and refresh token. This can usually be done by redirecting the user to the OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint.
   - Implement a user-friendly message informing the user that their session has expired.

2. **Implement Token Refresh Logic**:
   - Ensure your SPA includes robust token management logic to detect expired tokens and prompt the user for re-authentication in a seamless manner.

3. **Review and Adjust Token Lifetime Policy**:
   - In Azure AD, assess the current token lifetime policies.
   - For SPAs, ensure proper configurations are in place where applicable. Adjust the refresh token lifetime if necessary, keeping in mind security best practices.

4. **Monitor User Activity**:
   - Implement logic to log user activity and potentially warn users of impending token expirations when they approach the timeout thresholds.

5. **Provide Error Handling**:
   - Incorporate error handling in your application to gracefully manage the scenario where the refresh token has expired and inform the user of the required action (i.e., signing in again).

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Refresh tokens are critical for maintaining a userâ€™s session without requiring frequent logins. SPAs should use them carefully to provide a good user experience and ensure security.
- Be aware that some potential security policies, for example, those related to conditional access or MFA, might affect refresh token operations.

# AADSTS700084: The refresh token was issued to a single page app (SPA), and therefore has a fixed, limited lifetime of {time}, which can't be extended. It is now expired and a new sign in request must be sent by the SPA to the sign in page. The token was issued on {issueDate}.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS700084

#### Description
The error code AADSTS700084 indicates that the refresh token issued to a single page app (SPA) has expired. The refresh token for SPAs has a fixed lifespan, and when it expires, the application must initiate a new sign-in request.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Verify the Exact Error Message**: Ensure that the error you received exactly matches AADSTS700084.
2. **Check the Token Lifetime**: Review the expired refresh token's issued date and expiration time for clarity on the timeframe.
3. **Identify the Application**: Confirm the type of application that generated this error (i.e., was it a single-page application using MSAL.js or another library?).
4. **Review SPA Flow**: Understand the OAuth 2.0 flow your application is usingâ€”confirm if your application is attempting to get a new access token using the expired refresh token.

### Common Issues that Cause This Error
- **Expired Refresh Token**: The refresh token has reached its maximum lifetime and cannot be renewed.
- **Improper Handling of Sessions**: The SPA might not be correctly managing session expirations and renewals.
- **User Inactivity**: The user has not interacted with the application for an extended period.
- **Token Scopes**: The scopes requested for the token are limited, affecting the refresh process.
- **Configuration Issues**: Registration issues in Azure AD may lead to improper token handling.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **User Re-Authentication**:
   - Prompt users to re-authenticate when the AADSTS700084 error occurs.
   - Redirect users to the login page for a fresh authentication and to acquire a new set of tokens.

2. **Implement Token Expiry Handlers**:
   - In your SPA, implement handlers for token expiry. When a token is about to expire, proactively check if a refresh token can be used before it expires.
   - For example, use the `expires_in` or `expires_at` properties returned with the access token.

3. **Increase User Engagement**:
   - Encourage users to interact with the SPA periodically to prevent inactivity timeouts.

4. **Token Configuration**:
   - If you are using the Microsoft Identity platform, check the lifetime settings for your application tokens in Azure AD. While SPAs have a fixed refresh token lifetime, ensure you are aligned with best practices.

5. **Review Application Permissions**:
   - Ensure the application has the right permissions configured in Azure AD to obtain necessary tokens.

6. **Test with Different Users**:
   - Validate if the problem is specific to certain user accounts or roles.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **User Experience**: Make sure to communicate to users why they are being asked to sign in again due to expiration of tokens.
- **Security**: Refresh tokens are sensitive, and proper handling is key to maintaining security.
- **Azure AD Changes**: Be aware that Microsoft could update token policies; ensure that your application is monitoring the documentation for any changes.

### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**: Check the logs for signs of authentication flows and related errors. Specifically, look for entries around token acquisitions.
- **Network Traces**: Use **Fiddler** or **Browser Developer Tools** to capture network logs while reproducing the issue. Pay particular interest to HTTP status codes.
  - Inspect outgoing requests to the token endpoint and examine responses for errors.
- **NetTrace**: If using .NET, consider capturing a NetTrace to provide deep insights into the authentication flow and any underlying .NET issues.

By following the troubleshooting steps and considerations, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the AADSTS700084 error effectively.

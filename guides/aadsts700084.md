## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS700084:

**Description:** The refresh token was issued to a Single Page App (SPA), with a fixed, limited lifetime which cannot be extended. The token has expired and requires the SPA to send a new sign-in request.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. Verify the error code and description accurately match the issue.
2. Check the format and content of the refresh token.
3. Confirm the timestamp when the refresh token was issued (issueDate).
4. Determine the lifetime of the refresh token ({time}).

#### Common Issues:
1. **Using expired tokens**: Ensure that you are not using an expired refresh token.
2. **Incorrect SPA setup**: Incorrect configuration of the SPA or token management settings.
3. **Failure to renew tokens**: Not implementing the necessary logic to fetch a new token when it expires.
4. **Network or server issues**: Connectivity problems preventing token refresh requests from reaching the server.

#### Resolution Strategies:
1. **Fetch New Token**: Prompt the SPA to initiate a new sign-in request to obtain a fresh token.
2. **Reconfigure Token Management**:
    - Adjust the SPA configuration to handle token expiration more effectively.
    - Implement logic to automatically renew tokens before they expire.
3. **Clear Cache and Cookies**: If using a browser-based SPA, clearing the cache and cookies might resolve any issues related to expired tokens.
4. **Check Token Validity**: Periodically check token validity and prompt the user to sign in again when needed.
5. **Network Troubleshooting**:
    - Verify network connectivity to ensure token refresh requests can reach the authentication server without any interruptions.
    - Check the server logs for any errors or issues.

#### Additional Notes:
- **Security Considerations**: Always prioritize security when dealing with authentication tokens. Never expose tokens or sensitive information in insecure environments. Use secure methods for token exchange.
- **Documentation**: Refer to the identity provider's documentation for specific guidance on handling token expiration and refreshing in SPAs.
- **Persistent Token Management**: Consider implementing a more robust token management system that handles token expiration and renewal seamlessly in your SPA.

By following these troubleshooting steps and resolution strategies, you should be able to address the AADSTS700084 error related to a refresh token issued to an SPA. Remember to prioritize security and regularly monitor and update your token management processes.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error

- **Service Outages**: There may be issues or outages on Azure AD service affecting sign-in processes.
- **Misconfigured Applications**: The application settings in Azure AD may not be properly configured, leading to token issuance problems.
- **Expired or Invalid Credentials**: User credentials may be expired, incorrect, or not working.
- **Tenant Restrictions or Policies**: Admin-imposed restrictions or conditional access policies that prevent signing in.
- **Incorrect URLs**: The redirect or callback URLs may be misconfigured in the application settings.
- **API Permissions**: The application may not have the required permission to request tokens.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

2. **Validate User Credentials**:
    - Ask the user to reset their password, and try signing in again.
    - Check if the account is locked or disabled.

3. **Check Conditional Access Policies**:
    - In the Azure Portal, go to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Conditional Access**.
    - Check if there are any policies affecting the users or the application in question.

4. **Check Service Health**:
    - Monitor the [Microsoft Service Health Dashboard](https://status.azure.com/en-us/status) for latest updates on Azure services.

5. **Re-test the Sign-In**:
    - Have users retry signing in after making the changes or checking settings.

6. **Open a Support Ticket**:

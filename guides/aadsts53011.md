# AADSTS53011: User blocked due to risk on home tenant.


## Troubleshooting Steps
## Error Code AADSTS53011 Troubleshooting Guide

### Overview:
The error code AADSTS53011 indicates that a user is blocked due to risk assessment on their home tenant. This typically involves security measures in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) that prevent users from accessing resources deemed risky.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Verify User Identity**:
   - Confirm the user's identity and ensure that you are dealing with the correct account.

2. **Check User's Home Tenant**:
   - Identify the user's home tenant. This is the Azure AD tenant where the user account was created.

3. **Assess the Risk Level**:
   - Investigate whether the user has been flagged for risk in the Azure AD portal by checking conditional access policies.

### Common Issues that Cause AADSTS53011:
1. **User Account Suspended**: The account may have been disabled by an administrator due to suspicious activity.
2. **Risky Sign-ins Detected**: The user may have experienced sign-in attempts from unexpected locations or devices.
3. **Conditional Access Policies**: There may be conditional access policies in place that block access based on risk assessment.
4. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Requirement**: The user might not have completed the MFA requirement if configured for their account.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **Review Risky User Dashboard**:
   - Go to the Azure portal and navigate to **Azure Active Directory > Security > Risky users**. Check if the user is present and what risk events are associated with their account.

2. **Reset User Account**:
   - If the user is blocked, you may need to reset the user's password and verify their identity through another method.
   - Navigate to **Users > [User's Name] > Reset password**.

3. **Adjust Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Review existing conditional access policies to see if any are causing the block.
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory > Security > Conditional Access** to update policies. If a policy is too restrictive, consider modifying or disabling it temporarily for testing.

4. **Review Sign-ins**:
   - Check **Azure Active Directory > Sign-ins** to review failed sign-in attempts and their details, including locations and devices used.

5. **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - Ensure that the user completes necessary MFA prompts if enabled.
   - The user may need guidance on how to register for MFA.

6. **Contact Home Tenant Admin**:
   - If the user is from a different organization/tenant, they will need to contact their admin for further assistance as their home tenant may have specific security measures in place.

### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- **User Education**: Educate users about secure sign-in practices to minimize risk detection.
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for unusual login attempts in Azure AD for proactive monitoring.
- **Testing After Resolution**: After applying changes, instruct users to attempt a sign-in again and monitor for any further errors.

- [Troubleshoot sign-in issues in Azure AD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/troubleshoot-authentication)

### Advice for Data Collection:
1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - If the issue occurs in a client application, collect relevant logs from Event Viewer (Windows Logs > Application and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > AAD) to gather any error details.

2. **Network Tracing (Nettrace)**:
   - Use the built-in Windows tool (netsh trace) or a third-party tool to capture network packets during the sign-in attempt to identify unusual behavior.

3. **Fiddler for Web Requests**:
   - Use Fiddler to capture HTTP/HTTPS traffic to analyze the requests made during the sign-in process. Check for redirects or blocked requests indicating why the authentication failed.

Following these steps should help in diagnosing and resolving the AADSTS53011 error efficiently. Always ensure to follow your organizationâ€™s guidelines for security and data management practices when handling user accounts and data.

# AADSTS7000218: The request body must contain the following parameter: 'client_assertion' or 'client_secret'.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS7000218

**Error Description:** The error code AADSTS7000218 indicates that the OAuth 2.0 token request is missing a required parameter, either `client_assertion` or `client_secret`. This typically occurs during the authentication process when integrating with Azure Active Directory (AAD).

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Verify the Request Type:**
   - Confirm that the request being made is indeed a token request (typically a POST request) and not some other type of request.

2. **Inspect the Request Body:**
   - Use tools such as Fiddler, Postman, or your browser's network debugging tools to inspect the request being sent to the token endpoint.
   - Ensure the request body contains either:
     - `client_assertion`: A signed JWT assertion.
     - `client_secret`: A shared secret.

3. **Check the Endpoint URL:**
   - Make sure you are sending the request to the correct Azure AD token endpoint (`https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token`).

4. **Validate Client ID:**
   - Ensure that you are using the correct `client_id` corresponding to the application registered in Azure AD.

### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **Missing Client Assertion or Secret:**
   - The request lacks the necessary authentication parameter (`client_assertion` or `client_secret`).

2. **Incorrect Request Format:**
   - The request body might not be formatted properly (for instance, using incorrect content type, such as not specifying `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`).

3. **Expired or Invalid Client Secret:**
   - If using a `client_secret`, ensure it has not expired or been regenerated.

4. **Misconfiguration in Azure AD:**
   - Application settings in Azure AD (such as Redirect URIs, Application permissions) may not match the expected configuration.

5. **Token Endpoint Misconfiguration:**
   - Ensure the authorization grant type is supported (confidential clients should use client secrets).

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Adding `client_secret` or `client_assertion`:**
   - If using `client_secret`:
     - Include the parameter in the request body:
       ```plaintext
       client_id={your_client_id}
       client_secret={your_client_secret}
       grant_type=client_credentials
       ```

   - If using `client_assertion`:
     - Generate a signed JWT token and include it in the request body:
       ```plaintext
       client_id={your_client_id}
       client_assertion={your_client_assertion}
       client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer
       grant_type=client_credentials
       ```

2. **Check Application Permissions:**
   - Ensure the application has the necessary API permissions granted and consented to by the admin.

3. **Validate Client Secrets:**
   - If using `client_secret`, check in the Azure Portal under the "Certificates & secrets" section of your application that the secret is valid.

4. **Review Azure AD Application Settings:**
   - Ensure that the redirect URIs, authentication methods, and supported account types match your application's needs.

5. **Testing with Postman:**
   - Use Postman to test sending a request to the token endpoint to rule out issues with the application code.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Confidential vs. Public Clients:**
  - Ensure that your application is configured correctly as either a Confidential Client (using client secrets or assertions) or a Public Client (which should not use secrets).
  
- **SDK Maturity:**
  - If you're using an SDK or library, make sure you are using an up-to-date version that correctly implements the OAuth flow.

### Advice for Data Collection

- **Event Viewer Logs:**
  - For applications running on Windows, check the Event Viewer for any logs that may provide insights related to authentication or network errors.

- **Fiddler or Other Proxy Tools:**
  - Use Fiddler to inspect HTTP requests and responses, ensuring parameters are being passed correctly.

- **Network Trace Tools (NetTrace):**
  - Capture network traffic to observe the requests sent to Azure AD and responses received for further insights.

By diligently following these steps and consulting the linked documentation, you should be able to resolve the AADSTS7000218 error effectively.

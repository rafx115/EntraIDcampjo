## Troubleshooting Steps
Here is a detailed troubleshooting guide for the error code AADSTS65001 with the description "DelegationDoesNotExist - The user or administrator hasn't consented to use the application with ID X. Send an interactive authorization request for this user and resource." This error usually occurs in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) when the user or administrator has not consented to using the specified application.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Verify Application ID (X):** Identify the Application ID referenced in the error message, as it is crucial for further troubleshooting.
2. **Confirm User/Service Principal:** Check if the user or service principal intended to access the application has the necessary permissions.

### Common Issues:
1. **Missing User Consent:** The user has not granted consent to the application.
2. **Administrator Consent Required:** The application requires admin consent which hasn't been granted.
3. **Incorrect Application Permissions:** The application might have incorrect or missing permissions configurations.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Interactive User Consent:**
    a. Generate an interactive authorization request for the user by initiating the consent flow.
    b. The user can grant necessary permissions during the consent process.
    c. Use the URL `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/authorize?client_id={clientId}&response_type=code&redirect_uri={redirectUri}` to trigger the consent flow.

2. **Administrator Consent:**
    a. If the application requires admin consent, an administrator must grant the required permissions.
    b. Use the URL `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/adminconsent?client_id={clientId}&redirect_uri={redirectUri}` to trigger admin consent.

### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- **Tenant Context:** Ensure that you are performing these actions within the correct Azure AD tenant.
- **Permissions Documentation:** Review the application's documentation for specific permission requirements.
- **Error Message Interpretation:** Understand the error message to pinpoint the exact issue for effective troubleshooting.

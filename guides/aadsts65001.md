### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS65001 Error Code: DelegationDoesNotExist

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:

1. **Confirm the Error Message**: Ensure that the error code is indeed
   AADSTS65001 with the description "DelegationDoesNotExist."
2. **Identify Application ID (X)**: Note down the specific Application ID
   mentioned in the error message as it will be required for troubleshooting.

#### Common Issues:

1. **Missing Consent**: The user or administrator has not granted consent for
   the application to access the resources.
2. **Incorrect Configuration**: Issues with the application registration,
   permissions, or token configurations.
3. **Outdated Access Token**: The access token might have expired or become
   invalid.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **User Consent**: a. Instruct the user experiencing the error to log in to
   the application where the error occurred. b. Trigger an interactive
   authorization request to obtain user consent.

2. **Administrator Consent**: a. If the error involves an administrator, ask
   them to grant consent for the application. b. This can typically be done
   through Azure AD portal or using PowerShell commands if needed.

3. **Check Application Permissions**: a. Verify that the required permissions
   are correctly configured for the application in Azure AD. b. Ensure that the
   Application ID in the error message matches the intended application.

4. **Token Handling**: a. If the access token is expired, handle token
   expiration by requesting a new token. b. Check token issuance and renewal
   processes within the application.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:

* **Token Lifetime**: Be aware of the token expiration time and handle token
  renewal as needed.
* **Client Application Configuration**: Ensure that the client application is
  configured correctly to handle consent flows.
* **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging to track consent requests and
  errors for troubleshooting in the future.
* **Documentation**: Update documentation regarding user and administrator
  consent processes for future reference.

By following the above troubleshooting guide, you should be able to address the
AADSTS65001 error with the "DelegationDoesNotExist" description effectively.
Remember to communicate clearly with the user or administrator to ensure
successful resolution.

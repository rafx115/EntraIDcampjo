## Troubleshooting Steps
The error code AADSTS65001 indicates that the application you are trying to access does not have the necessary permissions that the user or administrator has not consented to. The full description you provided states: "DelegationDoesNotExist - The user or administrator hasn't consented to use the application with ID X. Send an interactive authorization request for this user and resource." Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS65001

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Identify the Application**: Find the application ID (App ID) mentioned in the error. This is crucial for determining which application is causing the consent issue.
2. **Determine User Role**: Verify the user's role and permissions in Azure Active Directory (AAD).
3. **Check User Status**: Ensure the user is active and has the necessary licenses.
4. **Check for Prior Consent**: Investigate whether the user or admin had previously provided consent for the application.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error:
1. **Lack of Admin Consent**: The application might require permissions that need admin-level consent.
2. **API Permissions**: The specific permissions requested by the application are not granted in the Azure AD portal.
3. **Conditional Access Policies**: Security policies may block the application's access to necessary resources.
4. **Scopes Not Configured**: The requested scopes in the authentication request may not be fully defined or configured incorrectly.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **User Consent Flow**:
   - If the application allows user consent, ask the user to perform an interactive sign-in to provide consent.
   - Redirect the user to the authorization endpoint of the application to trigger the consent prompt.

2. **Admin Consent**:
   - If admin consent is required: 
     - Navigate to the Azure Portal.
     - Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations**.
     - Find the application using the App ID.
     - Go to **API permissions** and review the permissions requested.
     - Click on **Grant admin consent** (if you have the necessary administrative rights).
  
3. **Verify Permissions**:
   - Ensure all necessary API permissions are correct and have been granted.
   - If the application is using scopes, check that they are properly defined and approved.

4. **Review Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Check if there are Conditional Access policies in place that may restrict access to the application.
   - Adjust the policy settings as necessary.

5. **Check Application Registration**:
   - Ensure the application is registered properly under **App registrations** in Azure AD.
   - Validate that the redirect URIs and other configuration settings match those used in the sign-in request.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- If the application is third-party, consult their documentation or support to ensure you have configured it correctly.
- Consider the user's group membership and any group-based access rights that might impact consent.

#### Advice for Data Collection:
- **Event Viewer**: Check the Event Viewer on the client machine for any related logs or errors, specifically under the Application logs.
- **Network Tracing**:
  - **NetTrace**: Use network tracing to capture requests and responses during the authorization flow. 
  - **Fiddler**: Monitor HTTP traffic for any failed requests and inspect the headers to ensure the right permissions are being requested.

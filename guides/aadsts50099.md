# AADSTS50099: PKeyAuthInvalidJwtUnauthorized - The JWT signature is invalid.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Error Code: AADSTS50099 - PKeyAuthInvalidJwtUnauthorized

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Confirm Error**: Ensure the error is consistent and not transient.
2. **Check JWT Signature**: Verify that the JWT signature is indeed invalid and not tampered with.
3. **Review Recent Changes**: Determine if any recent configurations or updates might be related to the issue.

#### Common Issues:
1. **Incorrect Key Configuration**: Use of incorrect keys to sign or verify the JWT.
2. **Expiration or Tampering**: JWT has expired or was tampered with in transit.
3. **Invalid Token Format**: JWT token structure might not adhere to the required format.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Review JWT Payload**:
   - Decode the JWT token.
   - Check for any anomalies in the payload.

2. **Verify Key Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the correct keys are being used for signing and verification.
   - Check if the keys are up-to-date and valid.

3. **Check JWT Validity**:
   - Verify the token's expiration time.
   - Double-check that the token was not modified in transit.

4. **Token Renewal**:
   - If the token is invalid or expired, request a new token from the authorization server.

5. **Refresh Token**:
   - If applicable, consider using a refresh token to obtain a new JWT.

6. **Troubleshooting Tools**:
   - Utilize tools like JWT.io or online JWT signature verifiers to analyze and validate the JWT.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- **Security Measures**: Handle JWT tokens securely to prevent tampering.
- **Token Expiry**: Regularly check and refresh tokens to avoid expiration issues.
- **Bearer Token Handling**: Ensure that token handling processes are correctly implemented.

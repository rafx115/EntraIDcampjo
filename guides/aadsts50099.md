Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS50099: PKeyAuthInvalidJwtUnauthorized - The JWT signature is invalid

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Confirm Error Code:** Ensure that the error code is indeed AADSTS50099 with the description PKeyAuthInvalidJwtUnauthorized.
   
2. **Check JWT Signature:** Validate that there is an issue with the JWT signature. This may involve examining the token or log details provided with the error message.

3. **Review Recent Changes:** Identify any recent changes made to the authentication configuration, keys, certificates, or integration that could have triggered the error.

**Common Issues that Cause this Error:**

1. **Incorrect Signing Key:** The JWT signature validation fails due to an incorrect signing key in the token or configuration.

2. **Token Tampering:** The JWT token has been modified or tampered with, leading to an invalid signature.

3. **Algorithm Mismatch:** The algorithm used to sign the JWT does not match the algorithm expected by the authentication service.

4. **Expired Token:** The JWT token has expired, causing the signature verification to fail.

**Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:**

1. **Verify Token Source:** Ensure that the JWT token is generated and signed by a trusted source.

2. **Check Key/Certificate:** Confirm that the correct signing key or certificate is being used for JWT generation and verification.

3. **Validate Token:** Use a JWT debugger tool or library to validate the JWT token's signature and structure.

4. **Check Expiry:** If the token has an expiry, ensure that it is within the valid period when the JWT signature is being verified.

5. **Algorithm Matching:** Verify that the signing algorithm specified in the token matches the expected algorithm set up in the authentication service.

6. **Refresh Token:** If possible, try generating a new JWT token and see if the issue persists.

**Additional Notes or Considerations:**

1. **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement detailed logging and monitoring for authentication processes to quickly identify and troubleshoot such signature validation errors.

2. **Token Renewal:** If the issue persists even after generating a new token, consider checking the token renewal process and the implementation of refresh tokens.

3. **Documentation and Error Handling:** Ensure that detailed documentation is available for developers integrating the authentication service, including error code explanations and troubleshooting steps for common issues.

By following these steps and strategies, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the AADSTS50099 error related to the JWT signature validation issue effectively.

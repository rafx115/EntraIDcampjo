# AADSTS50099: PKeyAuthInvalidJwtUnauthorized - The JWT signature is invalid.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The error code **AADSTS50099**, accompanied by the message "PKeyAuthInvalidJwtUnauthorized - The JWT signature is invalid.", indicates issues related to the validation of a JSON Web Token (JWT). This error typically occurs in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) integrations using PKeyAuth (Public Key Authentication).

Here is a detailed troubleshooting guide:

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Check User and Authentication Context:**
   - Verify that the user experiencing the issue is correctly registered in Azure AD.
   - Ensure that the user is using the correct authentication method expected by the application.

2. **Token Acquisition:**
   - Confirm that the application acquires the JWT token properly.
   - Check if the token is being generated before the request that triggers the error.

3. **Inspect the JWT Token:**
   - Decode the JWT token using tools like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to inspect its structure, including the header, payload, and signature.
   - Verify that the claims within the JWT match expected values.

### Common Issues that Cause AADSTS50099
1. **Invalid Signature:**
   - The signing key used to sign the JWT does not match the key used during token validation.
   - The token may have been altered during transmission, corrupting the signature.

2. **Token Expiry:**
   - The token might be expired. Check the `exp` claim in the JWT payload.

3. **Wrong Audience or Issuer:**
   - The `aud` (audience) or `iss` (issuer) claims may contain values not recognized by the application.

4. **Mismatched Application ID:**
   - The JWT might have been generated for a different application or client ID.

5. **Clock Skew Issues:**
   - Check for time discrepancies between the server generating and validating the JWT.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Validate Token Signature:**
   - Ensure the application can retrieve the correct signing keys from Azure AD (usually accessible via the well-known endpoints). This is achieved using the URL:
     ```
     https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration
     ```
   - Use the `jwks_uri` from the above configuration to obtain the public keys.

2. **Use Correct Claims:**
   - Ensure the `aud` and `iss` claims match the application’s configuration.
   - Review and confirm proper application registration values in Azure AD.

3. **Update Libraries:**
   - If using authentication libraries (e.g., MSAL), ensure they are up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues with Azure AD.

4. **Check Token Lifetime:**
   - Confirm that tokens are not being reused after expiration. Implement token refresh logic as needed.

5. **Debug Application Logic:**
   - Review the code that handles JWT acquisition and validation to ensure proper error handling and logic flow.

6. **Consider Clock Synchronization:**
   - Ensure all servers on which the application runs have synchronized clocks using a time source.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- If you’re in a development environment, verify connection strings and configurations are correctly set for testing against appropriate Azure AD tenants.
- Look into conditional access policies in Azure AD that may restrict access.

### Advice for Data Collection
1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - Check the application event logs for any related errors at the time of the JWT authentication.

2. **NetTrace:**
   - Capture a network trace to observe the requests and responses to Azure AD, noting where the token might be failing.

3. **Fiddler:**
   - Use Fiddler to intercept the traffic and inspect the actual JWT being sent with requests, checking headers and payloads for correctness.

These steps should guide you through diagnosing and resolving the AADSTS50099 error effectively.

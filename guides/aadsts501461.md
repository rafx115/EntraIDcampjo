# AADSTS501461: AcceptMappedClaims is only supported for a token audience matching the application GUID or an audience within the tenant's verified domains. Either change the resource identifier, or use an application-specific signing key.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The error code AADSTS501461 indicates that there's an issue with the audience (aud) claim in tokens when attempting to use the Azure Active Directory (AAD) with mapped claims. Here is a detailed troubleshooting guide for this particular problem.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS501461

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Understand the Context**: Determine what action you were trying to perform when the error occurred (e.g., app login, API call).
2. **Check Application Settings**: Verify the application registration settings in Azure AD, particularly focusing on **Application IDs**, **Redirect URIs**, and **API permissions**.
3. **Examine the Token**: If possible, capture and decode the JWT token that generated the error to inspect the claims, especially the audience (aud) claim.

#### Common Issues that Cause this Error
1. **Incorrect Resource Identifier**: The resource URI used for obtaining the token does not match the application's GUID or verified domains.
2. **App Configuration**: The application might be misconfigured concerning the Azure AD settings regarding claim configurations.
3. **Domain Validation**: The application audience might not be correctly validated against the tenant's verified domains in Azure AD.
4. **Using Default Signing Key**: The application might be using a default signing key that isn't compatible with mapped claims.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Check the Resource Identifier**:
   - Ensure the resource identifier you are using in your authentication request matches the application (client) ID from your Azure AD app registration. 
   - It should look something like this: `https://<YourAppName>` or `api://<YourAppId>`.

2. **Validate Audience Claim**:
   - Decode the access token using a tool like [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/) to inspect the `aud` claim. Ensure it exactly matches the application ID or a domain from the tenant's verified domains.

3. **Check Application Registration in Azure AD**:
   - Navigate to the Azure portal.
   - Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations** > Select your application.
   - Review the **Application (client) ID** and ensure it is correctly referenced.

4. **Review Claims Configuration**:
   - Ensure that your application is set up to accept mapped claims properly.
   - Within Azure AD, check **Token configuration** for any claims that might conflict with the audience.

5. **Switch to an Application-specific Signing Key**:
   - If using mapped claims, ensure you are using an application-specific signing key.
   - To create and manage keys, go to **Certificates & secrets** in the application registration in Azure AD.

6. **Modify Token Request**:
   - If you're trying to access multiple APIs, ensure that the scope in your token request is valid for your application's registered scopes.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Testing with Postman or Fiddler**: Consider using tools like Postman or Fiddler to simulate requests and inspect headers and tokens in detail.
- **Use Latest SDKs**: When implementing authentication, ensure you are using the latest libraries and SDKs provided by Microsoft for Azure AD.

#### Data Collection for Troubleshooting
- **Event Viewer Logs**:
  - Look for related applications in the Event Viewer and filter logs by timestamp when the error occurred.
  
- **Network Tracing with Fiddler**:
  - Use Fiddler to trace HTTP requests and responses from the authentication service to capture potential issues.
  
- **Nettrace Logs**:
  - To gather detailed diagnostics, you might want to enable and collect network traces using tools like *Network Monitor* or *Wireshark* to analyze the transaction.

Remember, careful examination and validation of the application configurations in Azure AD are key to resolving AADSTS501461 errors effectively. Make sure to follow the outlined steps and document any changes or findings for future reference.

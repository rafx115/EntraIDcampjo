## Troubleshooting Steps

Error Code: AADSTS90013 - InvalidUserInput: The input from the user isn't valid.

Troubleshooting Guide:

1. Initial Diagnostic Steps:

* Check if the user is entering the correct credentials (username and password).
* Verify if the user is entering any additional information, such as domain or
  tenant ID, that might be causing the error.
* Confirm if the user is using the correct authentication method required by the
  application.

2. Common Issues that Cause this Error:

* Incorrect username or password: The most common cause of this error is invalid
  credentials entered by the user.
* Missing or additional information: Users might be providing incorrect
  additional data, like domain or tenant IDs, that are required for
  authentication.
* Using the wrong authentication method: Some applications may require specific
  authentication methods (e.g., two-factor authentication) which might not be
  used by the user.

3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies: a. Verify User Credentials:
   * Ensure the user is typing the correct username and password without any
     typos.
   * Check for any leading or trailing spaces that might cause validation
     errors.
   * If the user has recently changed their password, ensure they are entering
     the new one.

b. Check Additional Information:

* If additional information like domain or tenant ID is required, make sure it
  is entered correctly.
* If unsure about what additional information is needed, check the application's
  documentation or contact the support team.

c. Authentication Method:

* Ensure the user is using the correct authentication method specified by the
  application.
* If two-factor authentication is enabled, make sure the user follows the
  correct steps for verification.

d. Clear Cache and Cookies:

* Sometimes, cached data can cause authentication issues. Clearing cache and
  cookies from the browser may resolve the error.

e. Reset Password:

* If all other steps fail, the user should try resetting their password to
  ensure they are entering the correct credentials.

4. Additional Notes or Considerations:

* Encourage the user to double-check all input fields before submitting
  credentials.
* Verify if the application or system is experiencing any service interruptions
  that might be causing the error.

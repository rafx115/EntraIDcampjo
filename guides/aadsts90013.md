# AADSTS90013: InvalidUserInput - The input from the user isn't valid.


## Troubleshooting Steps
When encountering the error code `AADSTS90013` which indicates "InvalidUserInput - The input from the user isn't valid", it typically signifies that there was some issue with the input provided by the user during an authentication or token request process with Azure Active Directory (AAD). Below is a comprehensive troubleshooting guide:

### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Confirm the Error Context**:
   - Identify where the error occurred (e.g., a web application, API, mobile app).
   - Gather information about the actions performed before the error occurred.

2. **Review User Input**:
   - Check what input was submitted by the user. This includes usernames, passwords, and any additional required fields.
   - Validate that the input matches expected formats or constraints (e.g., correct email format).

3. **Check the Client Environment**:
   - Determine the operating system and browser (if applicable).
   - Check for any networking issues that might cause incomplete requests.

### 2. Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Incorrect Credentials**:
   - Usernames and passwords that do not match are the most frequent cause.

2. **Expired Accounts**:
   - The user account may be disabled or expired.
  
3. **Invalid Login Policies**:
   - The AAD tenant may enforce specific login policies (e.g., MFA, password complexity) that haven’t been satisfied.

4. **Unregistered Application**:
   - The application requesting authentication might not be properly registered in AAD or it may have incorrect API permissions.

5. **Misconfigured Redirect URIs**:
   - The redirect URI set in the application's registration may not match the URI used by the application during authentication.

6. **Input Validation Errors**:
   - Required fields might be missing or incorrectly formatted.

### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Validate User Input**:
   - Ensure that the input data is formatted correctly. For email, it must conform to the standard email format (e.g., `user@example.com`).
   - Re-enter and verify user credentials carefully.

2. **Check User Account Status**:
   - Sign in to the Azure portal and check the user account status:
     - Is the account active?
     - Has the user recently changed their password?
     - Are there any MFA requirements that haven’t been addressed?

3. **Verify Application Registration**:
   - Confirm that the application is properly registered in the Azure portal under Azure Active Directory > App registrations.
   - Check that the application ID and client secret (if used) are correct.

4. **Review Redirect URIs**:
   - Ensure that the redirect URIs configured in the app registration match what is being used by your application.

5. **Confirm Permissions**:
   - Make sure that the application has the necessary API permissions granted and that admin consent (if required) has been provided.

6. **Consult AAD Logs**:
   - Access the Sign-ins logs in the Azure portal under Azure Active Directory > Sign-ins to see more details about the failed authentication.

### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Testing in Different Environments**: If feasible, test the login process in different environments (e.g., staging vs. production) to differentiate between environment-specific issues.
- **Updating and Documentation**: Ensure that your application and its dependencies are up to date to prevent compatibility issues with AAD.

### 5. Documentation for Guidance

Refer to the following official Microsoft documentation for further details:
- [Azure Active Directory Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)
- [Troubleshoot Azure AD sign-in errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/troubleshoot-authentication-error)
- [App registration for Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)

### 6. Advice for Data Collection

If further investigation is needed, especially with application logs or AAD logs, consider the following:

- **Event Viewer Logs**:
  - Check the Windows Event Viewer on the application server for any related errors or warnings.

- **Network Traces**:
  - Use network tracing tools (such as Wireshark, nettrace, Fiddler, or the browser's built-in network tools) to capture the HTTP requests and responses during the authentication process.
  - Analyze the request content to ensure that all parameters are being sent correctly.

- **Application Logs**:
  - If your application has logging enabled, review the logs for any relevant errors or debug information that may provide insight into the input issues.

By following this troubleshooting guide, you should be able to identify and resolve the `AADSTS90013` error effectively.

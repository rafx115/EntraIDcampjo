# AADSTS90013: InvalidUserInput - The input from the user isn't valid.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS90013: InvalidUserInput

The error code AADSTS90013 indicates that the input provided by the user is invalid during an authentication attempt with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Here is a detailed guide to troubleshoot this issue:

---

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify the Input**: Determine what input triggered the error. Common inputs include usernames, passwords, or parameters passed in the authentication request.
2. **Review Logs**: Check the application logs for any specific error messages surrounding the time when the error occurred.
3. **Reproduce the Error**: Try to reproduce the error by using the same input that previously caused the failure. This can help confirm whether the issue is consistent.

#### Common Issues that Cause AADSTS90013
1. **Invalid User Credentials**: The username or password input might be incorrect or malformed.
2. **Invalid Format of Input**: Inputs such as email addresses, usernames, or other parameters may not follow the expected format.
3. **Expired or Disabled Account**: User accounts that are disabled or have expired passwords may not be able to authenticate, resulting in invalid input errors.
4. **Incorrect Application Permissions**: The application may not have the correct permissions to access the resources.
5. **Security Features**: Conditional Access policies could prevent certain types of logins, depending on user location or device security status.
6. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Issues**: If MFA is required, failure to provide the second form of authentication could lead to similar errors.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Verify User Credentials**:
   - Check that the username and password entered are correct. If necessary, reset the password.
   - Ensure username adherence to format (e.g., email vs. username format).

2. **Check Account Status**:
   - Log into the Azure portal and verify that the user account is active and not disabled.
   - Check if the user's license and subscription are valid and up to date.

3. **Confirm Input Formats**:
   - Ensure input (username, email, etc.) follows expected formats.
   - Avoid special characters that may not be supported by Azure AD authentication.

4. **Review Application Registration**:
   - Ensure that the application is properly registered in Azure AD and has the necessary API permissions.
   - Check the redirect URIs and whether they match the configuration in the Azure portal.

5. **Inspect Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Review any conditional access policies that might impact user logins. Adjust settings as necessary.

6. **Enable MFA**:
   - If MFA is required by your organization, ensure the user has set up MFA correctly.
   - Verify that any required MFA tokens are being correctly provided.

7. **Test with Different Account**:
   - If possible, log in using a different user account to help determine if the issue is user-specific.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Keep in mind that changes made in Azure AD can take some time to propagate. If you make changes (like resetting passwords or changing permissions), wait a few minutes and then retry.
- Ensure that your application is updated to handle error messages correctly and provide users with informative feedback.

## Troubleshooting Steps
### Error Code: AADSTS50070 - SignoutUnknownSessionIdentifier

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. Take note of the error message and error code.
2. Check the context in which the error occurred (e.g., login, sign-out, session management).
3. Verify any recent changes or updates made to the application or authentication settings.
4. Check if the issue is reproducible across different environments or with different user accounts.

#### Common Issues:
1. User session mismatch: The name identifier provided during the sign-out request does not match the existing session.
2. Incorrect configuration of SAML attributes or identity provider settings.
3. Improper implementation of sign-out functionalities in the application.
4. Cache or cookie-related issues that prevent proper session management.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Verify Name Identifier:** Ensure that the name identifier sent during the sign-out request matches the one associated with the user's active session.
2. **Review SAML Attributes:** Check the mappings of SAML attributes in your identity provider configuration to ensure they align with what your application expects.
3. **Clear Cache and Cookies:** Instruct users to clear their browser cache and cookies to eliminate any potential session conflicts.
4. **Implement Proper Sign-Out Functionality:** Review and test the sign-out functionality in your application to ensure it correctly clears the user's session.
5. **Inspect Session Handling:** Examine how session data is managed within the application and ensure consistency with sign-out requests.
6. **Update Identity Provider Settings:** Make necessary adjustments in your identity provider settings if configurations are found to be misaligned.
   
#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- This error often occurs when there is a discrepancy between the user's current session identifier and the one specified during the sign-out process.
- Regularly monitor and maintain your authentication system to prevent session-related issues that may lead to this error.
- Consult with your development team or identity provider support for further assistance if needed.

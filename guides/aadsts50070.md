## Troubleshooting Steps


### Error Code: AADSTS50070 - SignoutUnknownSessionIdentifier


#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:

1. **Verify User Actions**: Confirm if the error occurred during a sign-out
   attempt by the user.
2. **Check Configuration**: Review the identity provider and session management
   settings to ensure they are configured correctly.
3. **Check Log Files**: Look for any relevant logs that can provide additional
   details about the error.
4. **Check Session Identifier**: Validate if the name identifier used during
   sign-out matches an existing session.


#### Common Issues that Cause This Error:

1. **Incorrect Name Identifier**: The name identifier used for sign-out doesn't
   match any active sessions.
2. **Session Management**: Inconsistent session handling mechanisms causing
   conflict during sign-out.
3. **Identity Provider Configuration**: Misconfigured identity provider settings
   leading to mismatched session data.
4. **Cookie Handling**: Issues related to cookie management can sometimes cause
   this error.


#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **Verify Name Identifier**:

   * Ensure that the name identifier used for sign-out matches a valid session

     identifier.

2. **Clear Session Data**:

   * Force clear the existing session data related to the user attempting to

     sign out.

3. **Identity Provider Configuration Check**:

   * Review the identity provider configuration settings to ensure they align

     with the expected session management behavior.

4. **Check Cookie Settings**:

   * Validate the cookie handling settings within the application and identity

     provider for any discrepancies.

5. **Force Sign Out**:

   * Implement a mechanism in the application to forcibly sign out the user and

     clear any existing session data.

6. **Re-authenticate**:
   * If needed, prompt the user to re-login after resolving the session mismatch

     issue.


#### Additional Notes or Considerations:


* **Session Expiry Handling**: Implement proper session expiry rules to prevent

  such mismatch errors.


* **Logging and Monitoring**: Enable detailed logging to track session-related

  activities for better troubleshooting in the future.


* **Compliance Considerations**: Ensure that the resolution steps comply with

  any relevant regulatory requirements regarding session management and user
  authentication.

### Error Code: AADSTS7500514
### Error Description: A supported type of SAML response was not found. The supported response types are 'Response' (in XML namespace 'urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol') or 'Assertion' (in XML namespace 'urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion'). Application error - the developer will handle this error.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Verify SAML Configuration**: Check the SAML configuration settings in both the identity provider (IdP) and the service provider (SP) side to ensure they are correctly set.
2. **Review SAML Response**: Examine the SAML response received by the service provider to identify any possible issues.

#### Common Issues:
- Incomplete or incorrect SAML configuration settings.
- Missing/invalid SAML Response from the Identity Provider.
- Incorrect XML namespaces in the SAML Response.
- Issues with SAML protocol versions.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Check SAML Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the SP and IdP configurations match.
   - Verify that the correct endpoints and URLs are configured.
   - Check if the required SAML attributes are mapped correctly.

2. **Analyze SAML Response**:
   - Review the SAML Response from the IdP for any errors or missing elements.
   - Ensure that the SAML Response contains either 'Response' or 'Assertion' within the specified XML namespaces.

3. **Inspect XML namespaces**:
   - Confirm that the XML namespaces specified in the SAML Response are 'urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol' for 'Response' and 'urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion' for 'Assertion'.

4. **Update SAML Configuration**:
   - Make any necessary corrections to the SAML settings based on the analysis conducted.
   - Reattempt the authentication process to see if the issue has been resolved.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- Ensure that both the IdP and SP support the same SAML version and configurations.
- Review any recent changes made to the SAML settings that could have caused the error.
- Consult with the developers of the application to identify any custom handling of errors that might be causing this issue.

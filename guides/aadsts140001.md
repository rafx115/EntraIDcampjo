# AADSTS140001: InvalidSessionKey - The session key isn't valid.


## Troubleshooting Steps
**Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS140001: InvalidSessionKey**

The error AADSTS140001 indicates that the session key is invalid during an authentication process, typically related to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Below is a comprehensive guide to diagnosing and resolving this issue.

### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Collect Error Details**:
   - Document the exact error message.
   - Note the time and date when the error occurred.
   - Identify the application or service involved, user accounts impacted, and any recent changes to configuration.

2. **Check Service Status**:
   - Visit the [Azure Status page](https://status.azure.com/en-us/status) to determine if there are any ongoing issues that could affect session validity.

3. **Review Authentication Logs**:
   - Access Azure AD sign-in logs to check for relevant error messages or patterns related to the AADSTS140001 error.

### 2. Common Issues that Cause this Error

- **Expired Session Key**: The session key may have expired if it was valid for a limited time.
- **Session Token Corruption**: The session token may be corrupted or incorrectly stored, causing authentication errors.
- **User Credentials Changes**: Changes to user credentials or security settings may invalidate the existing session.
- **Misconfigured Application**: Applications may have misconfigured authentication settings leading to invalid session keys.
- **Cookie Settings**: In web applications, cookies might not be set correctly or could be blocked.

### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

#### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache and Cookies

- Clear your browser's cache and cookies to ensure that corrupted data is not causing the session key issue.
- Re-attempt authentication after clearing the cache.

#### Step 2: Refresh the Session

- Logout from the application and log back in to force a new session creation.
- Ensure that no concurrent logins are causing session conflicts.

#### Step 3: Review Application Configuration

- Verify that your application is properly registered in Azure AD.
- Check for any recent changes in application registration (Redirect URIs, Application Secrets, API permissions).
- Ensure that the correct authentication method is being used, e.g., OpenID Connect vs. OAuth.

#### Step 4: Validate User Credentials

- Confirm that the user has not changed their password or other credentials.
- If applicable, reset the user’s password and attempt to log in again.

#### Step 5: Monitor and Increase Token Lifetime (if necessary)

- Review session token configuration in Azure AD.
- You might need to adjust the session token lifetime settings to avoid frequent expiration scenarios.

#### Step 6: Consult Microsoft Support

- If the issue persists after following the above steps, collect detailed environment information and contact Microsoft support for deeper investigation.
  
### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Security Best Practices**: Ensure that session management practices comply with security best practices to reduce risks associated with session hijacking or other vulnerabilities.
- **Use of Third-party Libraries**: If using any third-party libraries for authentication, ensure they are updated and compatible with Azure AD.

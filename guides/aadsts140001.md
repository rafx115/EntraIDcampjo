# AADSTS140001: InvalidSessionKey - The session key isn't valid.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Hereâ€™s a detailed troubleshooting guide for the error code **AADSTS140001** with the description *"InvalidSessionKey - The session key isn't valid."*

### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps
- **Check the Time Settings**:
  - Ensure that the system clock is synchronized with an internet time server. A significant time drift can cause session keys to be considered invalid.
  
- **Verify User Credentials**:
  - Confirm that user credentials used for authentication are correct. Invalid login attempts can lead to session issues.
  
- **Check Browser Sessions**:
  - Clear cache and cookies and try to authenticate again. Sometimes, invalid sessions are caused by corrupt cached data.

### 2. Common Issues that Cause This Error
- **Corrupted Sessions**:
  - Cached sessions on the client-side may become corrupt or stale, leading to invalid session keys.
  
- **Expired Tokens**:
  - The session key may have expired. Tokens often have a short life span for security purposes.
  
- **Network Connectivity Issues**:
  - Intermittent network connectivity can interrupt the session establishment process, leading to invalid session states.
  
- **Configuration Issues**:
  - Misconfigured applications, such as wrong redirect URIs or client secrets, can lead to authentication failures.

- **Multiple Authentication Attempts**:
  - Rapid repeated attempts to authenticate can lead to the session being invalidated.

### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
#### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache and Cookies
- Navigate to your browser settings and clear your browsing data, ensuring cookies and site data are also cleared.
  
#### Step 2: Verify System Time
- Ensure the system time and timezone are correct. Synchronize with a time server if necessary.

#### Step 3: Restart Authentication
- Log out of any existing sessions and retry logging in. Sometimes initiating a fresh session can resolve the issue.

#### Step 4: Check Application Configuration
- If you are the application developer, validate configurations such as redirect URIs, client IDs, and secrets in Azure AD App Registration. Ensure they match what is expected in the application.

#### Step 5: Review Token Expiry Settings
- If you manage the authentication tokens, check the lifespan settings. Ensure they are configured appropriately based on your application's needs.

#### Step 6: Monitor Network Connectivity
- Use tools to check if there are any network issues between the client and the authentication servers.

### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Security Policies**: Be aware of any conditional access policies that may affect user authentication if they recently changed.
  
- **Session Limits**: Some services impose limits on concurrent sessions, which could lead to invalid session key errors.

### 5. Documentation for Guidance
- **Microsoft Documentation**:
  - [Azure AD Error Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aad-error-codes) - This provides a detailed list of error codes alongside descriptions and potential resolutions.
  
- **Azure AD Token Lifetimes**:
  - [Token Lifetime Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-configurable-token-lifetimes)

### 6. Advice for Data Collection
#### Event Viewer Logs:
- Check for logs in the **Application and System** logs on Windows for any relevant signs around the time of the authentication attempts.

#### Network Tracing with Nettrace:
- Use `Nettrace` to capture networking data around the time of the issue to see if there is anything obstructing the requests to Azure AD.

#### Fiddler Setup:
- Utilize Fiddler to monitor requests and responses between your app and Azure AD. Look for request/response pairs that are returning with session-related errors.

### Conclusion
By following the steps outlined in this troubleshooting guide you can systematically diagnose and potentially resolve the issue related to the AADSTS140001 error. If the problem persists, consider reaching out to Microsoft Support with detailed logs and steps you have already undertaken for further assistance.

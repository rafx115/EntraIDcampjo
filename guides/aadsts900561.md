# AADSTS900561: BadResourceRequestInvalidRequest - The endpoint only accepts {valid_verbs} requests. Received a {invalid_verb} request. {valid_verbs} represents a list of HTTP verbs supported by the endpoint (for example, POST), {invalid_verb} is an HTTP verb used in the current request (for example, GET). This can be due to developer error, or due to users pressing the back button in their browser, triggering a bad request. It can be ignored.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS900561 Error Code

#### Error Description
Error code **AADSTS900561** indicates that the request made to the Azure Active Directory (AAD) endpoint was received with an HTTP verb that is not accepted by that endpoint. The error message specifies valid and invalid HTTP verbs, enlightening the user about the source of the issue.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Review the Error Message**:
   - Identify the valid HTTP verbs listed in the error message.
   - Identify the invalid HTTP verb that was used in the request.

2. **Check the Request Type**:
   - Verify the type of request being made (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
   - Ensure that your application sends requests using the correct HTTP verb that the endpoint expects.

3. **Confirm Endpoint URL**:
   - Verify that you are sending the request to the correct endpoint URL as per the API documentation.

4. **Check Browser Behavior**:
   - Confirm if the user may have retried or navigated back to the page, potentially submitting an unexpected request.

### Common Issues Causing This Error
- **Incorrect HTTP Method**: Using GET instead of POST or vice versa, depending on the API documentation.
- **Misconfigured Client Application**: The client application’s configuration may have incorrect URLs or endpoints.
- **Manual Re-Submission of Requests**: Users pressing the browser back button after an action can resend requests leading to bad requests.
- **Middleware or Proxy Interference**: Check for third-party software or middleware that may alter or affect the requests.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Check API Documentation**:
   - Ensure that your request method aligns with what the API documentation specifies for the endpoint.

2. **Modify the HTTP Verb**:
   - If the error specifies that the endpoint requires POST, change your HTTP request from GET to POST (or whatever the correct verb is).

3. **Handle Back Navigation**:
   - Implement client-side checks to prevent invalid requests when users press the back button. Use mechanisms like checks on the state of your application to avoid resubmissions.

4. **Testing**:
   - Test the endpoints using tools like Postman or CURL to confirm which HTTP verbs are accepted and verify that your implementation aligns with this.

5. **Debugging**:
   - Utilize developer tools in your web browser to inspect network requests and see their methods.
   - If applicable, check your application’s logs/configuration to ensure correct endpoint and request method usage.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Ignoreability**: Often, if the error occurs sporadically due to user actions, it may not require extensive troubleshooting, as it can simply be ignored in user-facing applications.
- **API Rate Limiting**: Excessive invalid requests could lead to throttling by the API, ensure that your application is not causing this issue inadvertently.

### Documentation for Guidance
- Azure Active Directory Documentation: [Azure AD Dev Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/)
- REST API Documentation for specific endpoints you are using. 

### Data Collection for Troubleshooting
- **Event Viewer Logs**: Check for any errors related to authentication or authorization in the Event Viewer (Windows) or appropriate logs in other operating systems.
- **Network Traces with NetTrace**: If you suspect network issues or traffic alterations, capture and analyze the network traces to see the exact request and response cycles.
- **Fiddler**: Use Fiddler to monitor and inspect HTTP(s) requests. This can be invaluable to verify the HTTP verbs, endpoints, request payloads, and headers sent from your application.

### Summary
Deploying these diagnostic strategies should help you resolve the AADSTS900561 error effectively. Always ensure your HTTP requests are aligned with the requirements of the API, and educate your users about the implications of navigation and re-submission actions.

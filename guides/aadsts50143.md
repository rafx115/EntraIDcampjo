# AADSTS50143: Session mismatch - Session is invalid because user tenant doesn't match the domain hint due to different resource.Open a support ticketwith Correlation ID, Request ID, and Error code to get more details.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50143 Error

The AADSTS50143 error occurs when there is a session mismatch due to domain hints that do not match the user's tenant. This can happen in multi-tenant environments or when there are misconfigurations in Azure Active Directory (AAD) settings.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Check the User Account**: 
   - Ensure that the user account experiencing the issue is part of the expected tenant.
   - Verify that the email domain of the user matches the expected tenant.

2. **Review Authentication Requests**: 
   - Check the application or service that the user is trying to access for the domain or tenant information being sent with the authentication request. 

3. **Examine the Configuration**: 
   - Review configurations related to the application in Azure AD (e.g., app registration) to ensure tenant and domain settings are correctly specified.

4. **Collect Error Information**: 
   - Obtain the Correlation ID, Request ID, and Error code from the error message to refer this to support if necessary.

#### Common Issues Causing AADSTS50143
- **Domain Hint Mismatch**: The domain hint (email domain of the user) does not match the tenant ID based on the resource being accessed.
- **Multi-Tenant Application Issues**: The application is registered in multiple tenants and there is confusion about which tenant context is being used.
- **Cached Credentials**: Cached sessions or credentials may lead to using outdated domain information.
- **Cross-Tenant Access**: Trying to access resources in a different tenant than where the application is registered.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Ensure Domain Matching**:
   - Verify that the user email or domain being used to authenticate matches the Azure tenant where the resource is hosted.
   - Update if necessary to use the correct domain/hint.

2. **Clear Browser Cache and Cookies**:
   - Instruct the user to clear any cookies or cached data in the browser that might be holding on to invalid session information.

3. **Use Correct Tenant Information**:
   - If the application is multi-tenant, make sure to specify the correct tenant ID or domain if applicable.

4. **Adjust Application Registration**:
   - Verify that the application is correctly registered in Azure AD with necessary permissions and that it supports the expected tenants.

5. **Session Revocation**:
   - In cases where stale sessions are suspected, revoke the session explicitly from Azure AD.
   - The user can do this through their account security features or an admin can revoke sessions through Azure AD admin center.

6. **Access the Resource with Correct Authentication Method**:
   - Check the authentication methods configured for the application (e.g., is it allowing only effectively signed in users or ambiguous cases).

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- If the issue persists after following the troubleshooting steps, consider documenting and submitting a support case with Microsoft, including all relevant details (Correlation ID, Request ID, gathering environment details).
- Network settings, firewalls, or proxies can also affect connectivity and could be part of the issue, ensure that those are configured properly.

#### Documentation for Guidance
- For further reading and to find more detailed steps, consider the following Microsoft documentation:
   - [Azure Active Directory Error Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aadsts-error-codes)
   - [Troubleshooting Azure Active Directory sign-in issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/troubleshoot-azure-ad-sign-in)
   - [Application Registration in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)

#### Advice for Data Collection
1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Check the Event Viewer on the client machine under "Windows Logs" -> "Application" or "Security" for any authentication-related logs.

2. **Network Traces**:
   - Use tools like Fiddler or Wireshark to capture network traces when the error occurs. Look for HTTP status codes and errors that may indicate why the authentication failed.

3. **Network Trace Command**:
   - Use `Netsh Trace start capture` in command prompt to capture live traffic and then stop it with `Netsh Trace stop`.

4. **Additional Logging**:
   - If the application has logging capabilities, enable verbose logging for detailed diagnostics during the authentication process.

By following these steps and guidelines, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the AADSTS50143 error effectively.

# AADSTS530035: BlockedBySecurityDefaults - Access has been blocked by security defaults. This is due to the request using legacy auth or being deemed unsafe by security defaults policies. For additional information, please visitenforced security policies.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Hereâ€™s a detailed troubleshooting guide for the Azure Active Directory error code AADSTS530035, known as "BlockedBySecurityDefaults".

### AADSTS530035: Blocked By Security Defaults - Troubleshooting Guide

#### 1. **Initial Diagnostic Steps**

- **Identify the Environment:**
  - Determine if the issue is occurring in a personal, enterprise, or educational account.

- **Gather User Information:**
  - Identify the user account that is encountering the error.
  - Note if the user is attempting to access resources from a particular application or service.

- **Confirm the Authentication Method:**
  - Check if the user is using Modern Authentication (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect) or Legacy Authentication (Basic Auth, etc.).

#### 2. **Common Issues that Cause this Error**

- **Using Legacy Authentication:**
  - Applications that try to authenticate using Basic Authentication instead of OAuth 2.0 can trigger this error due to security defaults.

- **Non-Compliance with Security Policies:**
  - If a sign-in attempt fails to meet requirements set by Azure AD security defaults (e.g., multifactor authentication, conditional access policies).

- **Blocked Applications:**
  - Certain legacy applications may be explicitly blocked from accessing Azure AD resources.

#### 3. **Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies**

**Step 1: Review Security Defaults Settings**
- Go to the Azure portal and navigate to Azure Active Directory > Properties > Manage Security Defaults.
- Ensure that security defaults align with your organizational security policies.
  
**Step 2: Identify the Application or Service**
- Check the logs in Azure AD sign-ins to find the application generating the error message.
  
**Step 3: Enable Modern Authentication**
- If using legacy applications, consider updating them to support Modern Authentication.
  - Update email clients (like Outlook) or other applications to the latest versions that support OAuth 2.0.

**Step 4: Use a Supported Application**
- If a non-compliant application is being used, switch to an application that complies with Azure AD security requirements.

**Step 5: Modify Azure AD Conditional Access Policies**
- If additional CA policies exist, review and modify them in Azure AD > Security > Conditional Access as necessary.

**Step 6: Disable Security Defaults (as a last resort)**
- If necessary and appropriate, security defaults can be disabled temporarily in Azure AD > Properties, but this should be a last resort after evaluating security implications.

#### 4. **Additional Notes or Considerations**

- **Impact of Security Defaults:** Security defaults aim to protect users by enforcing baseline security. Ensure that any changes retain essential security practices while resolving issues.
  
- **Testing:** After making changes, test with specific user accounts to confirm the issue is resolved.

#### 5. **Documentation for Guidance**

- Microsoft Documentation:
  - [What are security defaults?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/security-defaults)
  - [Enable or disable security defaults in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/whats-new#enable-or-disable-security-defaults-in-azure-ad)
  - [Documentation for Azure AD Conditional Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview)

#### 6. **Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer, NetTrace, Fiddler)**

- **Event Viewer:**
  - Check the Application and System logs for any entries related to authentication issues or application errors.

- **NetTrace:**
  - Consider capturing a network trace (using Microsoft Message Analyzer or Wireshark) during the authentication flow to identify the requests and responses being sent to Azure AD.

- **Fiddler:**
  - If Fiddler is being used, observe the request/response cycles, specifically looking for authentication headers and response codes.

  - In Fiddler:
    1. Start Fiddler and capture traffic.
    2. Reproduce the authentication failure.
    3. Review the traffic to see the specific responses and errors returned by Azure AD.

### Conclusion
By following these troubleshooting steps, you can effectively diagnose and resolve the AADSTS530035 error and ensure compliance with the security policies in Azure AD. Always keep security alignment a priority when modifying settings.

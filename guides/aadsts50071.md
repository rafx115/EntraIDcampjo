## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS50071
**Description:** SignoutMessageExpired - The logout request has expired.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Check Timestamps:** Verify the timestamp of the request and compare it with the current time settings.
2. **Check Session Duration:** Ensure the expiration time of user sessions aligns with the logout request timeframe.
3. **Review Logout Configuration:** Confirm that the logout configuration settings are correctly configured.

#### Common Issues Causing This Error:
- Incorrect system clock settings causing timestamp discrepancies.
- Session timeouts are set too short, leading to premature expiration of logout requests.
- Inadequate handling of expired logout requests in the application code.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Check System Clock:**
   - Adjust the system clock on the server or the application hosting the identity provider to synchronize with an accurate time source.
   
2. **Extend Session Durations:**
   - Increase the session timeout settings to allow sufficient time for logout requests to process successfully.
   
3. **Implement Error Handling:**
   - Update application code to handle expired logout requests gracefully by providing appropriate user feedback or redirecting users to re-authenticate.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- Regularly monitor and maintain your application's logout functionality to ensure optimal performance.
- Collaboration with your identity provider's support team might be necessary for deep-rooted issues.

# AADSTS50071: SignoutMessageExpired - The logout request has expired.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50071: "SignoutMessageExpired"

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Verify the Error**: Confirm that the error code AADSTS50071 is indeed the one being faced and clarify the context in which it appears (e.g., during sign-out process).
2. **Check the Logout Time**: Determine if the logout request is being sent after a long period of inactivity that might result in session expiration.
3. **Review User Actions**: Observe the sequence of actions taken by the user leading to the error, particularly focusing on any prolonged session duration before logging out.

#### Common Issues Causing This Error
1. **Session Timeout**: The session or the logout request might have expired due to inactivity, especially in applications with short session lifetimes.
2. **Clock Skew**: If the client and server clocks are misaligned, this can affect the validity period of tokens or messages.
3. **Token Expiration**: The security token used for the sign-out request could have expired before the logout request was processed.
4. **Network Interruptions**: Loss of connection during the logout process can prevent the signout message from being successfully completed.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Force Session Renewal**:
   - Inform users to perform a new login attempt before trying to logout again, which regenerates the session.
  
2. **Check Session Configuration**:
   - Review the configuration settings for logout timeouts in Azure AD and the application. If possible, extend the timeout duration.

3. **Ensure Time Synchronization**:
   - Check that the client and server systems time settings are configured and synchronized correctly (e.g., using NTP).

4. **Handle Network Issues**:
   - Advise users to check their network connectivity before performing logout. A stable connection facilitates proper sign-out processes.

5. **Implement Robust Logging**:
   - Ensure logging of session states and logout attempts to identify any trends or patterns related to timeouts.

6. **Clear Cache and Cookies**: 
   - Have users clear browser cache and cookies, and then re-attempt sign-out. This may remove stale session data.

7. **Retry Logout**: 
   - After correcting any of the above issues, attempt the logout process again to see if the issue persists.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Audit Azure Logs**: Regularly audit Azure AD logs to trace sign-in and sign-out activities, providing insights that may highlight recurring problems.
- **User Education**: Educate users regarding the impacts of prolonged inactivity and the need for timely sign-outs to avoid such exceptions.
  
#### Documentation for Guidance
- **Azure AD Documentation**: [Azure Active Directory documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/) provides insights into session management and authentication logs.
- **Microsoft Identity Platform**: Review the [Microsoft Identity Platform guides](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/) for more details on handling authentication-related issues.

#### Advice for Data Collection
1. **Event Viewer Logs**: 
   - Inspect the Windows Event Viewer for any relevant application or system logs related to Azure AD interactions.
   - Focus on logs under "Applications and Services Logs" > "Microsoft" > "Windows" > "Azure" for any AAD-related messages.

2. **Network Trace (Nettrace)**:
   - Use tools like Fiddler or Wireshark to capture and analyze HTTP/S requests and responses during the logout process to observe where the request fails.

3. **Fiddler Logging**:
   - Configure Fiddler to capture traffic and examine requests to Azure AD during sign-out attempts. Pay attention to request headers and responses for token expiry or error codes.

By following this guide, you can systematically troubleshoot and potentially resolve issues related to the `AADSTS50071` error, ensuring a smoother user experience with Azure Active Directory sign-out operations.

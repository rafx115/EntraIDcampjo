**Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS90009**

**Description:** TokenForItselfMissingIdenticalAppIdentifier - The application is requesting a token for itself. This scenario is supported only if the resource that's specified is using the GUID-based application ID.

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:**
1. Confirm the application ID and resource ID being used.
2. Check the permissions and scopes being requested in the authentication request.
3. Verify the configuration of the application in Azure AD.
4. Review the code implementation where the authentication request is being made.

**Common Issues that Cause this Error:**

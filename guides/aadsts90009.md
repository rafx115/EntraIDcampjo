## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS90009

**Error Description:**
AADSTS90009 - "TokenForItselfMissingIdenticalAppIdentifier - The application is requesting a token for itself. This scenario is supported only if the resource that's specified is using the GUID-based application ID."

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Understand the Error Context:**
   - Determine when the error occurs: during user sign-in, API requests, or service principal tokens.
   - Identify the specific application or resource the token is being requested from.

2. **Verify Application IDs:**
   - Make sure you understand the application ID (client ID) and resource ID being used in the request.

3. **Check the Application Registration:**
   - Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations.
   - Locate your application and check the API permissions, especially for any dependencies.

4. **Review Authentication Code:**
   - Look through the code or library you are using for obtaining the token. Note if you are mistakenly requesting a token that doesn't align with the resource.

#### Common Issues Causing This Error

1. **Incorrect Resource Identifier:**
   - The application requests a token for itself using the wrong type of identifier (e.g., using a URI instead of a GUID).

2. **Improper Application Registration:**
   - The application's manifest might not have the necessary permissions or configurations to allow the token exchange.

3. **Misconfigured Authentication Flow:**
   - The authentication model (e.g., Authorization Code Grant, Client Credentials) may not be correctly set up for the request.

4. **Use of URI instead of GUID:**
   - The application might mistakenly use a URI for its own identifier instead of the GUID.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Validate Resource and Application ID:**
   - Ensure you’re using the correct resource identifier. If it's the application itself, its GUID should be used, not a URI.
   - In Azure AD, the GUID can usually be found in the application registration under "Overview".

2. **Update the Request:**
   - Modify the token request to ensure that the resource parameter is set to the GUID of the application if it is requesting a token for itself.

3. **Check Permissions:**
   - Ensure that your application has the right set of permissions granted in Azure AD.
   - Grant admin consent if necessary.

4. **Review Manifest Files:**
   - Check and validate the application's manifest to confirm if it contains all required settings, including any permission scopes.

5. **Logs and Troubleshooting:**
   - Check the Azure AD sign-in logs for additional context around the error. Look for patterns or specific failures related to your application.
   - Use Azure AD’s diagnostics tools if available.

6. **Testing:**
   - Try updating your application and re-run your authentication requests. Test in a controlled environment if possible.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- The error may not always indicate that there's a problem with your application; it might be due to changes in Azure AD settings or permissions.
- Be cautious when changing application identifiers or permissions in a production environment.

#### Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer Logs, Network Traces, Fiddler)

1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - Check for any application-specific logs in Event Viewer that relate to the authentication process.
   - Look for entries related to authentication errors that coincide with your requests.

2. **NetTrace:**
   - Use tools like `WinDbg` or `Wireshark` to capture network traffic during the token request to analyze the communication flow.

3. **Fiddler:**
   - Run Fiddler to capture HTTP requests and responses between your application and Azure AD.
   - Inspect the headers and body for details about the token requests being made.

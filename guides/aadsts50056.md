### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Have the User Verify Credentials:**
   - Ask the user to double-check their username/email and password.

   - If the account is locked, wait for the lock period to expire or have an admin unlock the account manually.

5. **Password Expiry Notification:**

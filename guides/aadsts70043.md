# AADSTS70043: BadTokenDueToSignInFrequency - The refresh token has expired or is invalid due to sign-in frequency checks by Conditional Access. The token was issued on {issueDate} and the maximum allowed lifetime for this request is {time}.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS70043: "BadTokenDueToSignInFrequency"

The AADSTS70043 error indicates that a refresh token is either expired or invalid due to enforced sign-in frequency checks, typically associated with Azure Active Directory (AAD) Conditional Access policies. Below is a comprehensive troubleshooting guide.

#### **Initial Diagnostic Steps**

1. **Understand the Issue:**
   - Read the full error message carefully, noting the issue date and allowed lifetime that it specifies.
   
2. **Check Token Validity:**
   - Use tools like [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/) to decode the JWT token if you have it. Check expiration and other claims to see if the token is valid.

3. **Review Recent Changes:**
   - Identify any recent changes in your Conditional Access policies that might affect sign-in frequency.

4. **Verify User Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the user experiencing the issue is assigned to the correct group or policy that outlines the sign-in frequency settings.

#### **Common Issues That Cause This Error**

1. **Conditional Access Policy Configuration:**
   - The conditional access policies may enforce a sign-in frequency (e.g., requiring re-authentication after a specific period).

2. **Expired Refresh Token:**
   - The refresh token may have exceeded the maximum lifetime due to token timeout settings.

3. **Incorrect Client/Token Configuration:**
   - Misconfiguration of client applications, including scopes and token lifetimes.

4. **User Account Issues:**
   - User accounts that are inactive or have security flags may experience token validity issues.

#### **Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies**

1. **Check the Conditional Access Policies:**
   - Go to the Azure AD portal, navigate to Conditional Access, and review the policies applied to the affected user or group.
   - Pay special attention to the "Sign-in frequency" settings.

2. **Check Token Expiry:**
   - Ensure that the refresh token has not already expired. If it has, prompt the user to sign in again in the application.

3. **Re-authenticate the User:**
   - Have the affected user sign out and then sign in again to get a new refresh token. This often resolves the issue.

4. **Modify Conditional Access Configuration:**
   - If necessary, modify the Conditional Access policies to adjust the sign-in frequency settings. Keep in mind the security implications of relaxing these settings.

5. **Audit User Sign-ins:**
   - Use the Azure AD sign-in logs to review sign-in attempts and see if there are additional problems or feedback from the system.

6. **Update Application Configurations:**
   - Revisit the application settings related to AAD authentication and ensure the token lifetimes are configured adequately.

#### **Additional Notes or Considerations**

- **Security Implications:** Any changes to Conditional Access policies should consider security implications. Adjusting policies may reduce security posture.
- **User Education:** Inform users about signing in frequently or handling session timeouts effectively.

#### **Advice for Data Collection**

If you need to troubleshoot further, consider collecting data from:

1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - Check the Windows Event Viewer (under Applications and Services Logs -> Microsoft -> Windows -> AzureAD) for logs related to Azure AD authentication.

2. **Network Tracing:**
   - Use **NetTrace** or **Fiddler** to monitor the network traffic between your application and the Azure AD endpoints. Look for HTTP status codes and error messages related to token acquisition.

3. **Logs from the application:**
   - Ensure that your application logs include detailed error information, especially around authentication flows.

By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve issues related to the AADSTS70043 error effectively.

# AADSTS50074: UserStrongAuthClientAuthNRequiredInterrupt - Strong authentication is required and the user did not pass the MFA challenge.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS50074

Error Code **AADSTS50074** indicates that strong authentication is required for a user, yet they did not successfully complete the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) challenge. This error commonly arises in environments requiring additional security verification, especially in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) contexts.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify User's Status**:
   - Verify if the user account experiencing the issue is enabled for MFA in Azure AD.
   - Check if the user account is locked or if there are any sign-in restrictions.

2. **Reproduce the Issue**:
   - Attempt to log in as the affected user to observe the exact point of failure.
   - Note any prompts that the user receives and document the steps leading to the error.

3. **Access Logs**:
   - Review Azure AD sign-in logs for detailed error messages related to this authentication attempt.
   - Look for corresponding events in the Azure portal under Azure Active Directory > Monitoring > Sign-ins.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error

- **User Not Registered for MFA**: The user may not have completed the registration process for MFA.
- **Expired MFA Method**: The MFA method configured (e.g., phone number, authenticator app) may be outdated or no longer valid.
- **Network Issues**: Problems with connectivity might prevent the user from receiving authentication challenges.
- **Outdated Mobile Device**: The mobile device used for MFA might have a broken setup or outdated software affecting its functions.
- **Security Policies**: Conditional Access policies requiring MFA could be misconfigured or not properly implemented.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Check User MFA Status**:
   - Sign in to the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to "Azure Active Directory" > "Users".
   - Search for and select the affected user. 
   - Under "Authentication methods", ensure that the user has an MFA method registered.

2. **Re-register MFA**:
   - Direct the user to the MFA registration portal: https://aka.ms/mfasetup.
   - Ensure they properly register their phone number or authenticator app.

3. **Review Conditional Access Policies**:
   - In the Azure portal, check if Conditional Access policies requiring MFA are correctly configured.
   - Ensure that the user is included in relevant group memberships for those policies.

4. **Test MFA Operations**:
   - After registering methods, initiate a new sign-in attempt to see if the challenge now completes successfully.
   - If still failing, attempt to reset the authentication methods to ensure the user can set new methods.

5. **Examine Network Configuration**:
   - Ensure that there are no network security policies or firewalls blocking traffic to the Microsoft MFA services.
   - Ask the user to try using a different network (home Wi-Fi, mobile network).

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Verify that the user has the latest version of their MFA application (e.g., Microsoft Authenticator) installed on their device.
- In some cases, users may need to clear the app's cache or reinstall the app to resolve persistent errors.
- Review the Azure AD service health dashboard to ensure there are no ongoing issues with Azure AD authentication services.

#### Documentation for Guidance

- [Azure Multi-Factor Authentication documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted)
- [Troubleshoot Azure AD sign-in errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/troubleshoot-sign-in-errors)
- [Azure AD Conditional Access documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview)

#### Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer, Nettrace, Fiddler)

- **Event Viewer**:
  - Use Windows Event Viewer to check for any relevant authentication logs under "Applications and Services Logs" > "Microsoft" > "Windows" > "Authentication" or "AzureAD".
  
- **Network Tracing**:
  - Use **Nettrace** or **Wireshark** to capture network traffic during the login attempt to potentially identify any blocked traffic.

- **Fiddler**:
  - Use Fiddler to inspect HTTP/HTTPS requests made during the sign-in process. Look for responses that indicate specific failures or missed challenges.

By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose the AADSTS50074 error effectively and help the user complete their MFA challenge successfully.

1. **Confirm the Error Code:** Ensure that the error code displayed is indeed

   AADSTS50074 with the description
   "UserStrongAuthClientAuthNRequiredInterrupt - Strong authentication is

   required and the user did not pass the MFA challenge."

2. **Verify User's Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Status:** Check if the user

3. **Check Conditional Access Policies:** Verify if any conditional access

   policies are in place that could be triggering the MFA challenge for the user
   in this scenario.


#### Common Issues causing this error:

1. **Incomplete MFA Setup:** Users might not have completed the MFA setup

   process, leading to failure during the MFA challenge.

2. **Changed MFA Settings:** Changes in the MFA policy, such as increasing

   security requirements, can trigger the MFA challenge that the user did not
   pass.

   outdated, not reflecting the current user requirements.

1. **Ensure User Completes MFA Challenge:** 

   * Instruct the user to attempt the MFA challenge again, ensuring they follow

     the correct steps.

2. **Check MFA Configuration:** 

   * Review the MFA policies and configurations in Azure AD or the identity

     provider's settings.
   * Adjust the MFA settings if they are outdated or misconfigured.

3. **Review Conditional Access Policies:** 

   * Analyze the Conditional Access policies affecting the user.

   * Modify or create new policies to align with the necessary MFA requirements.

4. **Provide User Guidance:**    * Educate the user on the importance and 
process of completing the MFA

     challenge.
   * Offer support for any issues the user might face during the MFA process.


#### Additional Notes or Considerations:

  to identify patterns or anomalies leading to the error.

* **Communicate Changes:** Inform users proactively about any MFA policy updates

  or changes to prevent confusion during the authentication process.

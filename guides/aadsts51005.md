# AADSTS51005: TemporaryRedirect - Equivalent to HTTP status 307, which indicates that the requested information is located at the URI specified in the location header. When you receive this status, follow the location header associated with the response. When the original request method was POST, the redirected request will also use the POST method.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS51005 error

The AADSTS51005 error indicates a "TemporaryRedirect" condition, meaning that a requested resource has moved temporarily to a new location provided in the HTTP response's location header. Below is a comprehensive troubleshooting guide to address this error.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check the Response Headers:**
   - Review the HTTP response headers from the AADSTS51005 error response.
   - Look for the `Location` header; this will contain the URI you should redirect to.
   
2. **Verify the Request Method:**
   - Ensure that the method of your original request (usually POST) is noted, as a 307 status requires following the redirection with the same method.

3. **Examine the Client Application:**
   - Identify which client or service is generating this request. Note the surrounding context for the error, such as the operation being performed.

4. **Access Application URL:**
   - Try to access the URL specified in the `Location` header directly via a browser or API testing tool (like Postman) to see if the resource is available.

#### Common Issues that Cause this Error

1. **Misconfigured Redirect URIs:**
   - If using applications registered in Azure AD, ensure that the redirect URI is correctly configured.

2. **Permission Denied or Access Issue:**
   - The application may not have sufficient permissions to access the requested resource at the new location specified in the `Location` header.

3. **Incorrect Application Logic when Handling Redirects:**
   - The application’s logic may not be handling redirections properly, causing it to fail to follow the redirect.

4. **Network Issues:**
   - Proxy servers, VPNs, or firewalls may interfere with redirection or block the new location.

5. **Session or Context Issues:**
   - Sometimes, authentication sessions or contexts can be invalidated or misplaced, leading to the redirect failing to complete.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Follow the Location Header:**
   - For an immediate resolution, ensure the application follows the redirect indicated in the `Location` header.

2. **Verify Redirect URI in Azure AD:**
   - Go to the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to "App registrations" > select your application > "Authentication".
   - Confirm that the redirect URIs are correctly listed.

3. **Check Application Permissions:**
   - Within the Azure portal, confirm that the API permissions required by your application are granted.
   - If you recently changed permissions, ensure to re-grant admin consent.

4. **Inspect Application Code:**
   - Ensure the client code properly handles redirect responses (HTTP 307).
   - Leverage libraries that seamlessly manage redirection in HTTP requests.

5. **Diagnostics on Network and Settings:**
   - Disable any VPN or proxy temporarily to rule out network issues.
   - Check local settings that may be impacting connectivity.

6. **Re-authentication:**
   - Prompt a login again or clear the application’s session/cache to ensure there are no stale tokens.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Custom Error Handling:**
  Make sure your application’s error handling logic accommodates HTTP status codes and redirect handling properly.

- **User Experience:**
  If this redirect affects user flows, consider adding appropriate messaging or guidance in your application to handle unexpected redirects gracefully.

#### Data Collection for Further Investigation

1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - Collect logs from the Event Viewer on your system. Focus on ‘Application and Services Logs’ related to the specific app framework being used (e.g., ASP.NET).

2. **Network Traces:**
   - Use tools like **Network Monitor** or **Wireshark** to trace the network calls. Capture the entire session to analyze the forward and redirected requests.

3. **Fiddler:**
   - Download and set up Fiddler to inspect HTTP(S) traffic. Look for the sequence of requests and responses to identify the error details.

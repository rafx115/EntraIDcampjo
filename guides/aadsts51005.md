### Troubleshooting Guide for error code AADSTS51005: TemporaryRedirect

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:

1. **Confirm Error Message**: Ensure that the error message indeed mentions
   "AADSTS51005" and "TemporaryRedirect."

2. **Check API Documentation**: Refer to the API documentation to understand the
   significance of this error code and what actions it requires.

3. **Verify Request Parameters**: Check the request parameters sent to the API
   to confirm they are correct and properly formatted.

4. **Review Network Configuration**: Check the network configuration to ensure
   that there are no restrictions preventing the redirection.

#### Common Issues:

1. **Incorrect Redirect URI**: The target URI in the `location` header may be
   wrong or improperly formatted.

2. **Missing Authorization Header**: If authentication is required, ensure that
   the authorization token is included in the request headers.

3. **Firewall or Proxy Configuration**: Firewalls or proxies might be blocking
   the redirection response from the server.

4. **Middleware Interference**: Middlewares like reverse proxies may interfere
   with the redirection process.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **Follow the Location Header**: When encountering a 307 status, follow the
   `location` header URL provided in the response.

2. **Review Request Method**: If the initial request was a POST method, ensure
   that the redirected request also uses the POST method.

3. **Check Authorization**: Revalidate authorization tokens or credentials being
   passed in the redirected request.

4. **Validate Redirect URIs**: Ensure that the redirect URI specified during the
   initial request matches the URI provided in the redirection response.

5. **Network Investigation**: If issues persist, investigate firewall, proxy, or
   any network configuration that might be interfering with the redirection
   process.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:

* **Caching**: Sometimes, caching mechanisms might cause the redirection issue.
  Try clearing caches if necessary.

* **Support Documentation**: Check the support documentation or contact the API
  provider for specific guidance on handling this error code.

* **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to
  track the flow of requests and responses to pinpoint the exact cause of the
  redirection error.

By following these detailed troubleshooting steps, you should be able to
effectively diagnose and address the AADSTS51005 error with a TemporaryRedirect
status.

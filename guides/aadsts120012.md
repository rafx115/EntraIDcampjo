## Troubleshooting Steps
The error code AADSTS120012 with the description "PasswordChangeNeedsToHappenOnPrem" typically indicates that a user’s password has expired and needs to be changed on the on-premises Active Directory (AD) rather than in Azure Active Directory (AAD). Here’s a detailed troubleshooting guide to help you resolve this issue.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS120012

#### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps
- **Identify Affected User:**
  - Determine which user(s) are receiving the error.
  
- **Check User's Password Expiration Status:**
  - Log in to the on-premises Active Directory and check if the user's password is expired. You can do this by viewing the user properties in Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC).

- **Confirm User's Authentication Method:**
  - Determine if the user is using Azure AD for authentication or if they are trying to access resources that strictly require on-prem AD authentication.

#### 2. Common Issues That Cause This Error
- **Password Expiration:**
  - The user's password in the on-premises Active Directory might be expired, requiring a change before they can authenticate.
  
- **Synchronization Issues:**
  - There may be problems with Azure AD Connect, which synchronizes user accounts from on-prem AD to Azure AD.
  
- **User Account Configuration:**
  - The user account may be configured to require password changes on-premises or to not be permitted to change passwords in the cloud.

- **Expired Password Policies:**
  - Organization policies might enforce password changes at the domain level, leading to this error when users attempt to log in remotely via Azure AD.

#### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
- **Reset Password on-premises:**
  1. Ask the user to log into their on-premises workstation or VPN (if applicable).
  2. Change their password using CTRL+ALT+DEL (or other methods provided by your organization).
  
- **Verify Synchronization:**
  1. Check Azure AD Connect health:
     - Open Azure AD Connect on the server.
     - Check for any sync errors or alerts.
  2. Perform a manual sync if necessary using PowerShell:
     ```powershell
     Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta
     ```

- **Update User Attributes:**
  1. Confirm that the user's account attributes are accurately synced to Azure AD.
  2. Ensure that the `userPrincipalName` is correct and matches the login used by the user.

- **Check AD User Properties:**
  1. Open ADUC, find the user account.
  2. Check the 'Account' tab to verify if the following settings are applied:
     - "User must change password at next logon" is checked.
     - Password expiration settings are as expected.

- **Confirm Multi-Factor Authentication Policies:**
  - If MFA is configured, ensure users are compliant with its requirements, and check if MFA impacts their ability to authenticate.

#### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Remote Employees:**
  - Employees working remotely might need a VPN connection to access the on-premises Active Directory for password change operations.
  
- **Password Policies:**
  - Educate users about the organization’s password policies to avoid unexpected errors in the future.

- **Logging and Monitoring:**
  - Regularly monitor user authentication logs and events to identify trends or issues that may not be immediately apparent.

#### 5. Documentation
- Microsoft Documentation on Azure AD Error Codes:
  - [Azure AD Error Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aadsts-error-codes)

- Azure AD Connect Documentation:
  - [Azure AD Connect: Getting Started](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/deploy/concept-ras)

#### 6. Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer, NetTrace, Fiddler)
- **Event Viewer:**
  - Check the Event Viewer on the on-prem AD server under Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > ActiveDirectory:
    - Look for events related to password changes and authentication failures.

- **Network Trace:**
  - Use tools such as NetMon or Wireshark to capture network traffic if you're diagnosing issues with user connectivity.

- **Fiddler:**
  - If troubleshooting web authentication, run Fiddler to capture HTTP/S requests and responses from Azure AD when the user attempts to log in.
  - Ensure you have HTTPS decryption enabled in Fiddler to capture and decrypt the traffic.

By following this troubleshooting guide, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the AADSTS120012 error effectively.

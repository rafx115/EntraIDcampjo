# AADSTS50089: Authentication failed due to flow token expired. Expected - auth codes, refresh tokens, and sessions expire over time or are revoked by the user or an admin. The app will request a new login from the user.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50089 Error

**Error Description:**
The error AADSTS50089 indicates that authentication has failed due to an expired flow token. This typically happens for several reasons, usually involving the expiration or revocation of authentication tokens.

### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps

- **Identify the Context**: Determine when and where the error occurred. Was it during a sign-in attempt, token refresh, or API call?
- **Check User Activity**: Confirm if there were any recent changes made to user accounts, such as password changes, account locks, or admin revocations.
- **Confirm Token Lifetimes**: Verify the configured token lifetimes in Azure AD for the affected application.

---

### 2. Common Issues That Cause This Error

- **Token Expiration**: Authentication codes, refresh tokens, or sessions have expired.
- **Revoked Tokens**: Tokens may have been revoked or invalidated due to user actions or admin policies.
- **Session Timeouts**: User sessions may time out based on configured policies or inactivity.
- **Multiple Sessions**: Users logging in from multiple devices or applications may lead to sessions conflicting with each other.
- **Configuration Errors**: Potential misconfigurations in Azure AD and application settings affecting token lifetimes or scopes.

### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

#### Step 1: Refresh Token Handling

- Ensure your application requests a new access token using a refresh token when the existing access token expires. 
- Implement logic in your application to prompt users to re-authenticate if both access and refresh tokens are expired.

#### Step 2: Check Token Configuration in Azure AD

- Go to Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > App Registrations > [Your App] > Token Configuration.
- Verify the lifetime settings for Access Tokens, Refresh Tokens, and ID Tokens.
- Adjust the configurations if necessary.

#### Step 3: Account Verification

- **User's Account**: Check if the user account is in good standing. Look for any notices on the account status in Azure AD.
- **Admin Policies**: Ensure there are no conditional access policies that might be enforcing stricter authentication requirements.

#### Step 4: Reauthentication

- Prompt the user to log in again. This will regenerate the tokens and establish a new session.

#### Step 5: Log Review

- Check logs for authentication failures in Azure AD to identify further details surrounding the errors.

### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations

- **User Education**: Educate users on maintaining session management best practices if they find themselves repeatedly encountering token expiration issues.
- **Session Policies**: Understand the policies your organization has set for session management. Implementing a notification system to warn users of upcoming session expirations may enhance user experience.
- **Review Application Code**: Ensure that the application handles token expiration correctly and seamlessly.

### 6. Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer Logs, NetTrace, Fiddler)

- **Event Viewer**: Use the Event Viewer on Windows to check for relevant logs regarding application errors that may be contributing to authentication issues.
  - Path to check: **Windows Logs > Application or Security**
  
- **NetTrace**: Use network tracing tools to monitor the HTTP requests made during authentication. This may expose failed requests that could provide insight into the error.
  
- **Fiddler**: Use Fiddler to capture HTTP(S) traffic. This can allow you to see the requests and responses during the authentication process, helping identify failures in communication or token exchanges.

#### How to Capture Fiddler Logs
1. Open Fiddler and ensure it is capturing traffic.
2. Reproduce the error by attempting to authenticate again.
3. Look for failed requests and review response details and headers for errors.

By following this guide, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the AADSTS50089 authentication error effectively.

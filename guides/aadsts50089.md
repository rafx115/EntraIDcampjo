## Troubleshooting Steps
**Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS50089 - Authentication failed due to flow token expired**

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:**
1. **Verify the Error Code**: Ensure that the error code received is indeed AADSTS50089.
2. **Check User Access**: Confirm if the user account experiencing the issue is able to access other resources or applications successfully.
3. **Review Application Configuration**: Check the settings and configurations of the application giving the error to see if any misconfigurations are present.

**Common Issues That Cause This Error:**
1. **Token Expiration**: Authentication tokens such as auth codes, refresh tokens, or sessions might have expired.
2. **Revoked Tokens**: Admin or user revocation of tokens can cause authentication failures.
3. **Inactivity Timeout**: If the user has been inactive for a prolonged period, their tokens may have expired.
4. **Incorrect Configuration**: Misconfigured token lifetimes or settings in the application could lead to token expiration.

**Step-by-step Resolution Strategies:**
1. **Prompt User for Re-Authentication**:
   - Provide a user-friendly message indicating the authentication failure and prompt the user to log in again.
2. **Renew Tokens**:
   - Implement refreshing access tokens or requesting new tokens if they have expired.
3. **Verify Token Validity**:
   - Before processing requests, validate the tokens to ensure they are not expired or revoked.
4. **Monitor Token Lifetimes**:
   - Keep track of token expiration times to proactively refresh them before they expire.
5. **Review Application Configuration**:
   - Check the application configurations related to token lifetimes and refresh token mechanisms to ensure they are correctly set up.

**Additional Notes or Considerations:**
- **User Notification**: Make sure to inform users if their session has expired and guide them on re-authentication steps.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging mechanisms to track token activities and monitor for any anomalies or recurring issues.
- **Regular Maintenance**: Conduct periodic reviews of token configurations and refresh mechanisms to prevent similar authentication failures in the future.

# AADSTS9002332: Application '{principalId}'({principalName}) is configured for use by Microsoft Entra users only. Please do not use the /consumers endpoint to serve this request.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS9002332

#### Overview of Error
The error code **AADSTS9002332** indicates that the application is configured to be used only by Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) users and is not available for consumer accounts. This often happens when the application tries to authenticate a user who is not part of the enterprise directory.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Check User Accounts**:
   - Verify whether the user account attempting to sign in is part of the correct directory (Azure AD). Confirm that the user is not a personal Microsoft Account (MSA).

2. **Review Application Registration**:
   - Inspect the application's registration settings in the Azure portal to ensure it's configured correctly.

3. **Identify Endpoint Used**:
   - Confirm the endpoint used during authentication requests. Ensure it's not pointing to the `/consumers` endpoint, which is meant for personal accounts.

4. **Authentication Code Review**:
   - Review the authentication code to ensure that itâ€™s correctly implemented to use Azure AD for enterprise users.

### Common Issues that Cause this Error
1. **Misconfigured Application**:
   - The application may be incorrectly configured to accept users from Microsoft Entra, resulting in it rejecting consumer accounts.

2. **Incorrect Endpoint**:
   - Using `/consumers` instead of `/organizations` or `/common` in the OAuth/OpenID Connect endpoint.

3. **User Type Misfit**:
   - The user attempting to log in is not part of the organization or is using a personal email address (e.g., hotmail.com, outlook.com).

4. **Tenant Settings**:
   - Settings on the tenant that restrict who can access certain applications. 

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify Application Configuration**:
   - Go to Azure Active Directory in the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to "App registrations" and select your application.
   - Ensure it is registered under the correct Azure AD tenant and that the account type allows only Azure AD users. Check the `Supported account types` section.

2. **Adjust Authentication Endpoints**:
   - If you are using the Microsoft identity platform, double-check that you are using the `/organizations` or `/common` endpoint:
     - `/organizations`: for organizational accounts only
     - `/common`: can be used for both organizational and personal accounts
   - Update your authentication request accordingly.

3. **Change Application Type if Needed**:
   - If your application needs to support both organizational and personal accounts, consider adjusting its configuration to include both types.

4. **Add Necessary API Permissions**:
   - Review the necessary API permissions in Azure. Ensure that the permission model you are using is appropriate for the user base.

5. **Test with Different Accounts**:
   - Attempt to authenticate using an enterprise account and a consumer account to observe different behaviors.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure you monitor for any changes in requirements or features within Azure AD or Microsoft Entra applications that may affect how this error appears.
- Consider implementing error handling in the application's authentication code to provide clearer feedback about why authentication has failed.

### Documentation for Guidance
- **Microsoft Documentation**:
  - [Authentication and authorization basics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)
  - [Application registrations in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)
  - [Configure your app for managed identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)

### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**:
  - Check the Event Viewer logs on the server where the application is hosted for any related errors or security events.
  
- **Network Traces**:
  - Use tools like **Fiddler** or **Wireshark** to capture network traffic. Look for any failed requests to the Azure AD endpoint and inspect their responses.

- **Debugging with NetTrace**:
  - Use `nettrace` to capture detailed traces of the application's communications. This can help in understanding if there's a malformed request making it to the Azure service.

### Common Issues that Cause This Error

   - New passwords may not meet complexity requirements leading to issues indirectly related to current passwords.

3. **Account Lockout:**
   - If the account has been locked out due to multiple failed login attempts, changes might be prohibited until the account is unlocked.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify Current Password:**
   - Ensure the correct current password is being used.
   - If there is uncertainty, try signing into the account with the same credentials.

2. **Reset Current Password:**
   - If the current password is forgotten or lost, follow the password reset process.
   - This often involves using a secondary method of identity verification (like answering security questions or receiving a code via email/SMS).

3. **Client-Side Checks:**
   - Clear browser cache and cookies or try a different browser or device.
   - Disable any browser extensions that may interfere with the form submission.

4. **Check Password Policies:**
   - Review Azure AD password policies for the user and ensure the new password meets all specified criteria including length and complexity.
   - If policies are too restrictive, consider adjusting them as appropriate with admin consent.

5. **Account Security Settings:**
   - Check whether the account is locked out or if there are any restrictions put in place by the administrator.

6. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Review logs in Azure AD or any related systems to see if there are additional details regarding failed login attempts or password changes.

# AADSTS75008: RequestDeniedError - The request from the app was denied since the SAML request had an unexpected destination.


## Troubleshooting Steps
The AADSTS75008 error code indicates that a SAML request was denied because it contained an unexpected destination for the authentication request. This often occurs in environments using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for Single Sign-On (SSO) with SAML-based applications. Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide to help diagnose and resolve this issue.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS75008

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Read the Error Message:**
   - Identify the exact message associated with the AADSTS75008 error code, which indicates that the destination of the SAML request was unexpected.

2. **Verify Service Configuration:**
   - Ensure the application is properly configured in Azure AD and that both the SAML endpoint and the relay state URL are correct.
  
3. **Examine Response Logs:**
   - Check the application logs to see if there are any additional details about the SAML request being sent. 

4. **Test Different Scenarios:**
   - Try accessing the application from different browsers or devices to determine if the issue is consistent across different environments.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error
1. **Incorrect Assertion Consumer Service URL (ACS URL):**
   - The SAML request may be configured to point to an incorrect ACS URL.

2. **Mismatch of Entity IDs:**
   - Check that the Entity ID in your SAML configuration matches what Azure AD is expecting.

3. **SAML Configuration Issues:**
   - There may be discrepancies in the SAML configurations on both sides (the application side and Azure AD). 

4. **Conditional Access Policies:**
   - Conditional access policies in Azure AD may block or redirect the authentication request unexpectedly.

5. **Identity Provider (IdP) Misconfiguration:**
   - Ensure that all configurations on the IdP side (Azure AD in this case) are correct, including certificates and metadata.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Verify the ACS URL:**
   - Go to your Azure AD portal.
   - Navigate to the Enterprise applications section and find your application.
   - Check the “Single sign-on” configuration and ensure the ACS URL matches the URL expected by your application.

2. **Check Entity ID:**
   - Ensure that the Entity ID specified in your application matches the one configured in Azure AD.

3. **Review SAML Configuration:**
   - Ensure attributes such as audience, issuer, and signature configurations are set correctly in the SAML settings.

4. **Monitor Conditional Access:**
   - Examine the Azure AD Conditional Access policies to see if any policies might affect the SSO process.

5. **SAML Request Inspection:**
   - Use tools like Fiddler or browser developer tools to inspect SAML requests and responses. Look for discrepancies in the destination attributes or relay state.

6. **Reconfigure Application:**
   - If issues persist, consider reconfiguring the entire SSO setup, ensuring all necessary information is provided correctly.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that the certificates used for signing and encrypting SAML assertions are up to date and correctly configured.
- Be cautious about URL encodings in your SAML request presentation as they may cause some misinterpretations.
- Consider user permissions to make sure that they have access to the application.

#### Documentation Reference
- [Microsoft Documentation on SAML Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-saml-protocol)
- [Configuring SSO with SAML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v2-aspnet)

#### Advice for Data Collection
1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - If the application logs information, gather logs from the Event Viewer on the server hosting the application.

2. **Network Tracing:**
   - Use tools like **Nettrace** or **Fiddler** to capture network traffic:
     - Monitor the SAML requests and responses for the correct assertions and destinations.

3. **Fiddler:**
   - Install Fiddler and configure it to capture traffic, ensuring to check for relevant HTTP/HTTPS requests containing the SAML exchanges.

4. **Analyze Logs:**
   - Gather any logs from Azure AD and the application (if logging is enabled) to look for additional clues or error messages related to the failure.

By following this guide, you should be able to effectively troubleshoot and resolve the AADSTS75008 error related to unexpected SAML request destinations.

## Troubleshooting Steps

Here is a detailed troubleshooting guide for resolving the error code
AADSTS65004 with the description "UserDeclinedConsent" which occurs when a user
declines to consent to access the app:

Initial Diagnostic Steps:

1. Verify that the user was prompted to consent to the app during the sign-in
   process.
2. Check if the user explicitly declined consent or if there was any confusion
   in the consent flow.
3. Confirm if this is a recurring issue for multiple users or if it's an
   isolated incident.

Common Issues that Cause this Error:

1. User misunderstanding: The user may not fully understand the consent request
   or its implications.
2. Consent fatigue: The user may have declined consent accidentally or due to
   repeated consent requests.

   consent process leading to the error.

   for consent and the benefits of granting it. Address any concerns the user
   may have.

   app and consent to the access request when prompted.
3. Verify app permissions: Ensure that the app is requesting only necessary
   permissions and not overwhelming the user with unnecessary requests.
4. Check consent flow: Review the consent flow within the app to identify any
   issues or errors that may be causing the user to decline consent.
5. Provide guidance: Offer step-by-step instructions to the user on how to
   navigate the consent process effectively.

Additional Notes or Considerations:

1. User education: Educate users about the importance of granting consent for
   accessing the app features and functionalities.

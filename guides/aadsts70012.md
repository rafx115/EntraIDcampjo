# AADSTS70012: MsaServerError - A server error occurred while authenticating an MSA (consumer) user. Try again. If it continues to fail,open a support ticket


## Troubleshooting Steps
Here's a comprehensive troubleshooting guide for addressing the error code AADSTS70012, which indicates a server error while authenticating a Microsoft Account (MSA) user.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS70012

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Verify Current Status**:
   - Check the Microsoft services health dashboard (https://status.office.com) to see if there are any outages related to Microsoft Authentication Services.

2. **Reproduce the Error**:
   - Attempt to log in again to determine if the issue persists. Note the time and frequency of the attempts.

3. **Check User Account**:
   - Ensure that the MSA account is valid and active. Check for any restrictions or issues associated with the account.

4. **Network Connectivity**:
   - Confirm that you have a stable internet connection. Try accessing other Microsoft services or websites to verify connectivity.

5. **Device / Application Environment**:
   - Identify the platform (web, mobile, desktop) the user is trying to authenticate from and ensure that it meets the requirements and is updated to the latest version.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error
1. **Service Outages**: Microsoft services are experiencing downtime or issues.
2. **User Account Issues**: The MSA is locked, inactive, or has hit its usage limits.
3. **Network Problems**: Firewall or proxy settings might be interfering with the authentication process.
4. **Application Configuration Errors**: Misconfigured application settings that are not compatible with the MSA authentication process.
5. **Token Expiration or Invalid Tokens**: If tokens are expired or invalid, this can cause failures during authentication.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Retry Authentication**:
   - Allow users to wait a few minutes and try logging in again, as this could be a transient issue.

2. **Check Account Status**:
   - Instruct users to visit the account recovery page (https://account.live.com/password/reset) to check if there's an account issue.
   - Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is properly configured, as it can affect access.

3. **Adjust Network Settings**:
   - Review firewall and proxy settings to ensure that they aren’t blocking Microsoft services.
   - Disable VPNs temporarily to see if this allows authentication.

4. **Check Configuration Settings**:
   - Ensure that applications are configured correctly with the correct client IDs, secrets, and other settings required for MSA authentication.

5. **Application Logs**:
   - Check application logs for any additional error messages or codes that might provide more context on the failure.

6. **User Feedback**:
   - Ask the user for any recent changes in their environment (new software, updates, modifications) that could affect authentication.

7. **Contact Microsoft Support**:
   - If the issue persists and is reproducible, consider opening a ticket with Microsoft Support for further assistance.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Inform users that transient errors are not uncommon and may resolve after some time.
- Always ensure that service agreements and service limits are understood within the organizational context.

#### Advice for Data Collection (Event Logs, Traces, etc.)
- **Event Viewer Logs**:
  - Check Application and System logs on the machine attempting authentication.
  - Look specifically for Event IDs that relate to authentication issues (e.g., Event ID 4625 for logon failures).

- **Network Traces**:
  - Use **Network Monitor** or **Wireshark** to capture traffic during the authentication process to identify potential failures or anomalies in request/response.

- **Fiddler**:
  - If using Fiddler, configure it to capture HTTPS sessions to see the requests and responses between the client and Microsoft’s authentication servers. Look for any non-200 HTTP statuses.

Collecting this information can aid in pinpointing the cause of the failure, whether it's on the client-side or server-side.

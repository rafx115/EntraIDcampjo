# AADSTS90114: InvalidExpiryDate - The bulk token expiration timestamp will cause an expired token to be issued.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS90114: InvalidExpiryDate

#### Overview
The AADSTS90114 error occurs when there's an issue with the token's expiration timestamp, specifically that it will lead to an expired token being issued during a bulk operation in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This typically pertains to issues with the configuration of the token or issues related to time synchronization.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check Current Time**: Ensure that the server or system from which the request is being made has its system clock synchronized with a reliable time source (e.g., NTP server). Mismatched time can lead to incorrect expiration timestamps.

2. **Verify Token Request Parameters**: Inspect the parameters being sent in the token request, particularly anything related to expiration dates or times.

3. **Assess Configuration**: Review the Azure AD configuration settings related to the applications involved, particularly those dealing with token lifetimes.

4. **Review Logs**: Examine the Azure AD sign-in logs for any additional context or errors that occurred during the token request.

### Common Issues Causing the Error

1. **Time Synchronization Issues**: If the issuing system's clock is out of sync, the generated token's expiration time might not be valid.

2. **Configuration Errors in Azure AD**: Incorrect settings for token lifetimes, or custom policies that may conflict with standard behaviors can lead to expired tokens being issued.

3. **Improper Request Format**: The structure of the token request may not be compatible with Azure AD requirements.

4. **Bulk Token Requests**: Bulk operations may inadvertently create conditions where token expiration times are improperly calculated or configured.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

#### Step 1: Check System Time
- **Action**: Confirm that the systemâ€™s time is accurate and synchronized.
- **How to Check**: 
  - On Windows, use the command `w32tm /query /status`.
  - On Linux, use `timedatectl`.

#### Step 2: Validate Token Requests
- **Action**: Ensure that your application is sending the correct token request format.
- **How to Check**:
  - Use tools like Fiddler or Postman to monitor outgoing requests and confirm their structure.

#### Step 3: Review Azure AD Configuration
- **Action**: Examine token lifetime settings in Azure AD.
- **How to Perform**:
  - Navigate to Azure AD in the Azure Portal.
  - Under `Azure Active Directory` > `App Registrations`, select the application.
  - Go to `Authentication` and review settings for "Access token lifetimes".

#### Step 4: Inspect Bulk Request Logic
- **Action**: If using bulk requests, check the request logic for issues related to creating or managing tokens.
- **How to Check**:
  - Look at the business logic in your code that handles token generation and requests.

#### Step 5: Implement a Time Sync Solution
- **Action**: If a time synchronization issue is found, implement a reliable fix.
- **How to Implement**:
  - For Windows, configure the NTP service.
  - For Linux, ensure the `ntp` or `chrony` services are properly configured.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Service Accounts**: If bulk operations are being conducted via a service account, ensure that this account has the proper permissions and configurations related to token issuance.
- **Custom Policies**: Be cautious about using custom Azure AD policies, as they can interfere with standard behaviors.

### Data Collection Recommendations

- **Event Viewer Logs**: Collect logs related to application errors or security logs that might provide insights into token issuance or access errors.
  - Access this via `Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Application/Security`.

- **Network Trace with NetTrace**: Capture a network trace to examine the communication between your application and Azure AD.
  - Tools like Wireshark or Fiddler can help isolate HTTP requests.

- **Fiddler**: Set up Fiddler to monitor the requests made to Azure AD, looking specifically at the authorization requests and replies.

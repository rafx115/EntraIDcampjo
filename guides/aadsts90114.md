# AADSTS90114: InvalidExpiryDate - The bulk token expiration timestamp will cause an expired token to be issued.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS90114

#### Description:
The error code AADSTS90114 indicates an `InvalidExpiryDate` issue, meaning the bulk token expiration timestamp is set in such a way that it might cause an expired token to be issued. This can result in authorization failures during the authentication process.

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Check the Expiration Timestamp**:
   - Verify the expiration date and time configured for the bulk token.
   - Ensure that the time zone of the Expiration Date is correctly set.

2. **Identify the Affected Application**:
   - Determine which application is producing this error. Is it one of your custom apps or a third-party service?

3. **Review Authentication Logs**:
   - Check Azure Active Directory (AAD) sign-in logs for more contextual information regarding the error.
   - Look for timestamps and other relevant data pertaining to the errors.

4. **Confirm Time Synchronization**:
   - Ensure that the system's clock and time zone settings of the server generating the tokens are accurate and synchronized.

---

### Common Issues That Cause This Error:
1. **Incorrect Time Configuration**:
   - The system generating the token is not synchronizing its time correctly, leading to mismatched expiration timestamps.

2. **Configuration Error**:
   - An incorrect setting in the token generation process might lead to the creation of a token with an invalid expiration date.

3. **Expired Tokens**:
   - Older tokens may still be residing in cache or session storage, attempting to authenticate against expired tokens.

4. **Azure Service Issues**:
   - Occasional issues with Azure Active Directory or the associated services can affect token issuance.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **Verify Time Settings**:
   - Ensure that the machine or server issuing the tokens has the correct time set and is synchronized with an NTP server.
   - In Windows, you can check time settings using the command `w32tm /query /status`.

2. **Review Token Generation Logic**:
   - If you have implemented custom logic for generating tokens, review the logic to ensure that the expiration time is set correctly, e.g., never set an expiration time in the past.

   Example of setting expiration time correctly in code:
   ```csharp
   var expirationTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(60); // Set to expire in 60 minutes
   ```

3. **Check Application Configuration**:
   - Inspect the application's configuration settings to ensure no misconfiguration exists that could set the expiry date erroneously.
   
4. **Clear Cache or Session Storage**:
   - If transitioning from a previous token to a new one, ensure that any old tokens cached in your application are cleared to prevent reuse.

5. **Test with New Tokens**:
   - After changes, test authentication using newly generated tokens to ensure the issue has been resolved.

6. **Contact Azure Support**:
   - If the issue persists after successfully verifying settings and configurations, consider creating a support ticket with Azure for deeper analysis.

### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- Be mindful of daylight saving time adjustments, which may affect expiration settings depending on geographic location.
- Ensure that your application's authorization tokens are periodically refreshed and not just consumed as they were issued.

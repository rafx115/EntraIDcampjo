## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS90015: QueryStringTooLong

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Verify the Symptoms:** Confirm that the error message includes the description "QueryStringTooLong - The query string is too long."
2. **Check Recent Changes:** Identify any recent changes in the application or environment that might have triggered the issue.
3. **Review User Input:** Check if there's any large or excessive data being sent via the query string during the authentication process.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error:
1. **Large Amount of Data:** Excessive data being passed via the query string.
2. **Misconfigured Application:** Incorrect handling or processing of query string parameters in the authentication flow.
3. **Outdated Libraries or SDKs:** Using outdated or incompatible versions of libraries or SDKs that contribute to the issue.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Reduce Query String Length:** If possible, try to reduce the data passed in the query string to well below the Azure AD maximum limit.
2. **Use POST Instead of GET:** Consider switching to a POST request to pass data securely in the body rather than in the query string.
3. **Optimize Parameter Usage:** Evaluate the necessity of each parameter passed in the query string; remove any unnecessary or redundant parameters.
4. **Update Libraries:** Ensure all libraries, SDKs, and dependencies are up to date to prevent any compatibility issues.
5. **Review Azure AD Configuration:** Check the Azure AD configuration and permissions to ensure there are no restrictions causing the error.
6. **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement logging mechanisms to track the query string data flow and detect any anomalies.
  
#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- **Security Implications:** Make sure data being passed via query strings is not sensitive or confidential. Consider encrypting sensitive data or using more secure methods of data transfer.
- **Code Review:** Conduct a thorough code review to identify any areas where query string parameters are manipulated or processed inappropriately.

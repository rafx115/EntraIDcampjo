### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS90043

**Error Code Description**: AADSTS90043 - NationalCloudAuthCodeRedirection: The feature is disabled.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify the Context**:
   - Determine under which circumstances the error occurs. Is it during user authentication, application access, or while redirecting after authentication?
   - Check if the error is affecting all users or just specific accounts.

2. **Check Azure Active Directory (AAD) Settings**:
   - Review the settings specifically related to cloud and national cloud configurations.
   - Confirm if the National Cloud features are enabled in your AAD setup.

3. **Review Error Message Details**:
   - Look for any additional error messages or codes that may accompany AADSTS90043 to gather more context about the failure.

#### Common Issues that Cause this Error

1. **Feature Disabled**:
   - The specific feature of National Cloud Auth Code Redirection might be disabled for your tenant, which results in the AADSTS90043 error.

2. **Incorrect Application Registration**:
   - The application may be incorrectly registered in Azure, or the redirect URIs may not be set up properly.

3. **User Permissions and Roles**:
   - Ensure users trying to authenticate have the right permissions and roles assigned to access the application.

4. **Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Check if there are conditional access policies that might block users based on location, device state, or other conditions.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Enable the National Cloud Feature**:
   - If your organization requires National Cloud Auth Code Redirection, log into the Azure Portal:
     - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory**.
     - Check under **Enterprise applications** or **App registrations** to see if the National Cloud feature can be toggled on/off. Ensure that necessary settings are enabled.

2. **Review and Correct Application Registration**:
   - Go to **App registrations** in Azure AD:
     - Ensure that the redirect URIs set in the application match exactly with those defined in the application code.
     - Verify that the application is set up to use the correct national cloud (e.g., Azure Government, Azure China) if applicable.

3. **Check User Permissions**:
   - In the Azure Portal:
     - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory > Users**.
     - Check the roles assigned to the affected users, ensuring they have permission to access the application.

4. **Modify Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Go to **Security > Conditional Access**:
     - Review policies to identify any potential blocking rules. Modify or create exceptions based on your organization's requirements, ensuring that authentication flows are not blocked.

5. **Test the Changes**:
   - After making changes, test the application access to determine if the issue has been resolved. Clear browser cache or use an incognito window to eliminate cached states.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Ensure that any changes made do not unintentionally create security vulnerabilities. Always follow your organizationâ€™s security policies.
- Communication with Azure support may be required if the feature settings appear correct but the error persists.

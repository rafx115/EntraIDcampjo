# AADSTS90119: InvalidUserCode - The user code is null or empty.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The AADSTS90119 error code indicates that the user code being passed is null or empty. This typically occurs during the authentication process when the application expects a user code but does not receive one. Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide to help diagnose and resolve this error.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS90119

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check Initial Inputs:**
   - Verify the inputted user code in the application's authentication request. Ensure it is not null or empty.
   - Check if the user code is generated and displayed correctly on the authentication interface.

2. **Review Application Configuration:**
   - Ensure the application is configured properly to collect and utilize the user code.

3. **Identify the Context:**
   - Determine whether this error occurs during a specific scenario (e.g., mobile, web, desktop app).
   - Check if this is part of a multi-device or multi-user scenario.

#### Common Issues Causing this Error

1. **User Code Generation:**
   - The user code is not generated due to configuration issues or coding bugs.

2. **Client-Side Validation:**
   - The application did not validate that the user code was populated before making a request.

3. **User Interaction:**
   - The user did not enter a code or the input field was incorrectly handled (e.g., cleared by a reset or an error).

4. **Network Interruption:**
   - Network issues that prevent data being sent or properly received can sometimes lead to unexpected empty values.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify User Code Generation:**
   - Check if the user code is being generated successfully. Review the code where the user code is created and ensure that it is being passed correctly.

2. **Implement Input Validation:**
   - Ensure that the application has validation checks in place for user input. If the user code is an essential field, make sure it cannot be null/empty before proceeding with the authentication request.

3. **Update Client-Side Logic:**
   - Examine the UI/UX flow to ensure that the user code prompting and input retrieval is functioning as expected. 

4. **Debug Logging:**
   - Implement or review existing logging around the user code input stage. Log what the input is before making the token request to identify if it is empty or null.

5. **Test Different Scenarios:**
   - Execute tests using different browsers or devices to reproduce the issue and see if it's platform-dependent.

6. **Consult Documentation:**
   - Review the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication documentation to ensure compliance with current specifications.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Ensure that any custom implementations for managing user codes adhere to best practices and guidelines outlined by identity providers. 
- Keep frameworks and libraries used for authentication up-to-date to mitigate bugs.

#### Documentation for Guidance

- Microsoft Azure AD Authentication Documentation: [Azure AD Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios) 
- Error Codes Reference: [AAD Error Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aad-error-codes)

#### Advice for Data Collection

- **Event Viewer Logs:**
  - Check the Application logs for related errors during the time frame the issue occurred. Look for entries that clarify what was sent/received during the authentication attempt.

- **Network Tracing:**
  - Use **Fiddler** or **Postman** to inspect the requests and responses during the authentication flow. Look for the specific request that is resulting in the error to see if the user code is being sent correctly.
  
- **Network Tracing (nettrace):**
  - Use `nettrace` to gather detailed network operations to analyze any discrepancies in the request/response lifecycle.

By systematically following these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issues pertaining to AADSTS90119.

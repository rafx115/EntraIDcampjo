## Troubleshooting Steps
**Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS90119: InvalidUserCode - The user code is null or empty**

### Description
The error code AADSTS90119 indicates that the user code provided during the authentication process is either null or empty. This usually occurs in scenarios involving OAuth2 authorization where a code is required to authenticate a user.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Check the Code Submission**: Ensure that the user code being submitted is actually being extracted from a valid source and is not being lost or altered in the process.
2. **Log the Input**: If possible, log the input (user code) before the authentication request to verify that it is received as expected.
3. **Review Application Logs**: Check the application logs for any other associated errors that may provide context about why the user code is empty.

### Common Issues that Cause this Error
1. **User Code Generation**: The user code might not have been generated correctly. This can happen if the authorization request fails preceding this step.
2. **Front-End Code Issues**: There may be an error in the front-end function that collects or submits the user code.
3. **Timing Issues**: A delay between code generation and its submission could lead to a problem if the user navigates away or refreshes the page.
4. **Incorrect API Call**: The API call being made could be incorrectly formed or missing necessary parameters.
5. **Network Issues**: There may be intermittent connectivity problems that affect how the code is transmitted.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Reproduce the Error**: Attempt to replicate the issue under the same conditions to gather additional information.
2. **Check User Code Generation Logic**:
   - Ensure the logic for generating the user code is functioning correctly.
   - Review any APIs or services involved in generating the user code for possible errors or misconfigurations.
3. **Debug Front-End Form Submission**:
   - Use developer tools (like F12 in browsers) to inspect the form submission process.
   - Verify that the user code is being captured in the input field and is present in the request payload.
4. **Consider Network and Timing Issues**:
   - Implement mechanisms to prevent premature code submission.
   - Ensure there is adequate time between generating and submitting the user code.
5. **Review API Documentation**: Refer to the relevant API documentation to ensure correct request formation and parameter passing.
6. **Testing with New User Code**: If possible, generate a new user code and attempt to authenticate again to rule out issues with the previously generated code.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that users are instructed not to modify the user code, as any changes will lead to authentication failures.
- If using third-party libraries or SDKs, check they are updated to the latest versions to avoid bugs that might already be resolved.

### Documentation Links for Guidance
- [Microsoft Identity Platform Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/)
- [OAuth2 Authorization Framework](https://oauth.net/2/)

### Testing Document Reachability
To ensure documentation is reachable:
1. Open a web browser.
2. Navigate to the links provided above to ensure they load.
3. Confirm that the information on those pages is accessible and clear.

### Advice for Data Collection
- Collect detailed logs of the input being sent during the authentication request.
- Include timestamps, user identifiers, and the state of the application to provide context when seeking help or further troubleshooting.
- Consider gathering any relevant environmental data such as browser type, device specifications, and network conditions that might affect the authentication process.

### Summary
By following the steps outlined in this guide, users can troubleshoot the AADSTS90119 error effectively. It is crucial to ensure that the user code is generated, collected, and submitted correctly while accounting for any potential timing or network issues.

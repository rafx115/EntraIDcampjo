## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Here's a detailed troubleshooting guide for the AADSTS130006 error, specifically focusing on the "NgcTransportKeyNotFound" message.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS130006

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify the Context of the Error:**
   - Determine if the error occurred during a specific action, such as signing in, using a particular application, etc.
   - Check if other users on the same network or device are experiencing the same issue.

2. **Check Device Configuration:**
   - Ensure the device is running a supported version of Windows (Windows 10 or later).
   - Verify that the Windows Hello feature is correctly set up on the device.

3. **Review Recent Changes:**
   - Analyze if there were any recent changes made to the device, such as updates, app installations, or policy changes that could affect authentication.

#### Common Issues that Cause AADSTS130006

1. **Windows Hello Configuration:**
   - If Windows Hello is disabled or not configured properly, the NGC (Next Generation Credential) transport key cannot be found.

2. **Corrupt or Missing NGC Credential Store:**
   - The NGC folder could be corrupted or missing, leading to the inability to retrieve the transport key.

3. **Group Policy Settings:**
   - Certain policies may prevent the use of Windows Hello, blocking necessary access to the secure key storage.

4. **Device Trust Issues:**
   - The device may not be trusted by Azure AD, which can prevent the use of NGC.

5. **User Profile Issues:**
   - The user profile could be corrupted or improperly configured.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Re-enable Windows Hello:**
   - Go to **Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options**.
   - Disable Windows Hello, restart the device, and then re-enable Windows Hello.

2. **Reset NGC Key:**
   - Force a recreation of the NGC key:
     - Delete the contents of the NGC folder located at `%localappdata%\Microsoft\NGC`.
     - This action will remove existing Windows Hello configurations, so make sure you have your alternative login methods handy before doing this.

3. **Check Group Policy:**
   - Open the Group Policy Editor (`gpedit.msc`).
   - Navigate to **Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Hello for Business**.
   - Ensure that any policies that disable Windows Hello are not set.

4. **Check for Device Trust:**
   - Verify that the device is properly registered in Azure AD.
   - Navigate to **Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > Devices** and check if the device status is compliant.

5. **Create New User Profile:**
   - If the issue persists, create a new user profile:
     - Go to **Settings > Accounts > Family & other users**.
     - Click **Add someone else to this PC** and follow the prompts.
   - Log in with the new profile and test the Windows Hello setup.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Itâ€™s crucial to ensure backup plans or alternative authentication methods are in place when altering or resetting the NGC or Windows Hello settings.
- Ensure that the device has the latest Windows updates installed, as Microsoft frequently releases patches that address related issues.

#### Documentation for Guidance

- Microsoft Documentation on [Windows Hello for Business](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-overview) provides comprehensive information on configuration and troubleshooting.
- For Group Policy settings, refer to [Windows Hello Group Policy Settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/group-policy-settings).

#### Data Collection and Logs

1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - Open Event Viewer (`eventvwr.msc`).
   - Navigate to **Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Hello for Business** and check for any indicative errors.
   - Also, check under **Windows Logs > Application** and **System** for any related warnings or errors.

2. **NetTrace:**
   - Use `netsh trace start` and `netsh trace stop` to gather traces to investigate network activity related to Azure AD authentication.

3. **Fiddler:**
   - Install Fiddler to inspect HTTPS traffic during the authentication process. Use it to check if any requests fail and get a 403 or any other status.

This troubleshooting guide should help address AADSTS130006 errors effectively. If issues persist after following these steps, consider seeking support from Microsoft or troubleshooting further with additional tools and logging mechanisms.

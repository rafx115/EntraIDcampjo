2. Navigate to the "Users" section.
3. Select the affected user.
4. Perform necessary actions as described for the error.

### Step 2: Verify MFA Settings

1. Ensure that the user has MFA configured.
2. If necessary, guide the user through the MFA setup process.

## Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting Steps

When encountering the error code AADSTS90012 with the description
"RequestTimeout - The request has timed out," it indicates that the request sent
to the Azure Active Directory (AAD) has taken longer than the specified timeout
period to complete. Here's a detailed troubleshooting guide to address this
issue:

### Initial Diagnostic Steps:

1. **Confirm the Error:** Ensure that the error is consistently reproducible to
   rule out temporary network glitches or server issues.
2. **Check Network Connectivity:** Verify that the device or server making the
   request has a stable internet connection and can reach the Azure AD servers.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error:

1. **Slow Network Connection:** A slow or unstable internet connection can cause
   requests to timeout.
2. **Heavy Workload on Azure AD:** High traffic or heavy workloads on Azure AD
   servers can lead to timeouts.
3. **Long-running Processes:** Requests that involve complex operations or large
   datasets might exceed the default timeout.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **Increase Timeout Settings:**

   * Adjust the timeout settings in your application or API to allow for longer
     response times.

2. **Optimize Requests:**

   * Analyze the requests to Azure AD and optimize them to reduce the processing
     time. This can involve minimizing unnecessary data sent in the request or
     streamlining the authentication process.

3. **Retry Mechanism:**

   * Implement a retry mechanism in your code to resend the request if a timeout
     occurs. Ensure that the retry logic includes back-off strategies to prevent
     flooding the Azure AD service.

4. **Check Azure AD Service Status:**
   * Monitor the Azure AD Service Health Dashboard to check for any ongoing
     service incidents or outages that could be causing the timeouts.

### Additional Notes or Considerations:

* **Review Logs and Metrics:**
  * Check the application logs and Azure AD metrics for more insights into the
    specific requests that are timing out. This can help pinpoint the root
    cause.

* **Engage Azure Support:**

  * If the issue persists and is impacting your operations, consider reaching
    out to Azure Support for further assistance and troubleshooting.

* **Implement Caching:**
  * Utilize caching mechanisms to store repetitive data locally to reduce the
    need for frequent requests to Azure AD.

By following these steps and strategies, you can diagnose and address the
AADSTS90012 error code related to the "RequestTimeout" issue effectively.
Remember to test any changes in a controlled environment before deploying them
to production.

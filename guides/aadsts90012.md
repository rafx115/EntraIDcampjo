# AADSTS90012: RequestTimeout - The requested has timed out.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS90012: "RequestTimeout - The request has timed out."

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Replication of the Issue**:
   - Try to reproduce the error by performing the same action that triggered the timeout. Note the exact steps and scenarios under which it occurs.

2. **Check Service Status**:
   - Verify if there are any known outages or issues with Azure Active Directory (AAD) or related services by checking the [Azure Status Page](https://status.azure.com/).

3. **Network Status**:
   - Ensure that your internet connection is stable and that there are no network issues that could disrupt communication with AAD services.

4. **Browser and Client Checks**:
   - Clear the browser cache and cookies, or try using a different browser or an incognito window.
   - If a specific application is being used, ensure it is the latest version and compatible with AAD.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **Network Latency**: High latency or fluctuation in the network can lead to timeouts.
2. **Server Performance**: Overloaded servers or services may not respond in time.
3. **Long Running Operations**: Operations that take too long to complete can also cause a timeout.
4. **Firewall or Proxy Configurations**: Network policies that block or delay AAD requests.
5. **Session Timeouts**: Authentication sessions may expire if they take too long to process.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Check Application Timeout Settings**:
   - Review and, if necessary, increase timeout settings in the application that is making requests to AAD.

2. **Optimize Network Infrastructure**:
   - Work with IT to ensure that firewalls, proxies, and routers are configured to allow timely access to AAD. Check for any bottlenecks.

3. **Increase Resource Limits**:
   - If you control an application that interfaces with AAD, consider optimizing the code for better performance or scaling resources.

4. **Review the Application Code**:
   - Look for logging or steps that could potentially cause long processing times. Optimize SQL queries or web service calls as necessary.

5. **Implement Retry Logic**:
   - If the operation that is causing the timeout can be retried, implement retry logic with exponential backoff in the application code.

6. **Use Asynchronous Patterns**:
   - Where possible, utilize asynchronous programming patterns to prevent blocking the main thread during long operations.

7. **Load Testing**:
   - Perform load testing to see how your application behaves under realistic conditions. Identify potential points of failure or slowness.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Monitor Latency**: Continuously monitor network latency and application performance to detect trends or consistent patterns.
- **Authentication Token Lifespan**: Check if token lifespans are set appropriately; overly short token lifetimes could contribute to timeouts if there are long waits.
- **User Experience**: When timeouts occur for users, provide them with friendly messages and possibly retry options.

#### Documentation and Guidance
- Azure Active Directory error codes documentation: [Azure AD Error Codes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aad-error-codes)
- Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) documentation: [MSAL Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview)
- Azure Service Health: [Azure Service Health](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/status/)

#### Advice for Data Collection
1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Check the Event Viewer on Windows machines (Windows Logs -> Application / System) to find any entries related to authentication or application errors.

2. **NetTrace**:
   - Use Network Tracing tools like `Netsh trace` on Windows to capture packets and analyze the calls to AAD to see where the delays might be happening.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Use Fiddler to capture HTTP(s) traffic to see if requests to AAD are being made correctly and to inspect their timing and responses.

To implement any of the above recommendations, ensure you have the appropriate access permissions and take backups if making significant changes to your systems or applications.

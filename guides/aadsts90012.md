# AADSTS90012: RequestTimeout - The requested has timed out.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS90012: RequestTimeout 

**Overview:**
The error code AADSTS90012 corresponds to a `RequestTimeout` issue, indicating that a request sent to Azure Active Directory (AAD) has timed out. This can happen for various reasons related to network, service responsiveness, client configuration, or backend processing delays.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Check Service Status**: Verify if there are any ongoing issues with Azure services by visiting the Microsoft Azure status page.
   - [Azure Status](https://status.azure.com/en-us/status)

2. **Reproduce the Error**: Attempt to reproduce the error and determine if it occurs consistently or intermittently.

3. **Review Application Logs**: Check the logs of your application for any additional error messages or context around the time of the timeout.

4. **Network Connectivity**: Ensure that there are no network issues impacting the connectivity to Azure Active Directory.

### Common Issues Causing AADSTS90012:
1. **Network Latency**: High latency or packet loss that affects communication with Azure AD.
2. **Service Throttling**: Your application may be hitting throttling limits imposed by Azure AD due to excessive requests.
3. **Configuration Issues**: Wrongly configured endpoints or incorrect parameters could lead to timeout issues.
4. **Authentication Delays**: The request may be waiting for an external service to respond (e.g., an identity provider) which is taking too long.
5. **Heavy Load on Services**: Azure AD might be experiencing heavy load which can delay the processing of requests.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Increase Timeout Settings**: In the configuration of your application, consider increasing the timeout settings for requests to Azure AD. This varies depending on the platform (e.g., .NET, Java, etc.).

2. **Optimize Network Settings**:
   - Use network diagnostics tools to check for latency issues.
   - If possible, try from a different network or VPN to see if connectivity improves.
   
3. **Review and Optimize API Calls**:
   - Ensure that you are not making excessive calls to Azure AD.
   - Implement caching where appropriate to reduce the number of requests.

4. **Error Handling Code**:
   - Implement retry logic in your application to gracefully handle timeouts. Use an exponential backoff strategy for retries.

5. **Monitor Performance**: 
   - Use Azure Monitor or Application Insights to monitor your application's performance and track the number of requests and their response times to Azure AD.

6. **Contact Azure Support**: If you continue to encounter issues, consider opening a support ticket with Azure, providing detailed logs and information about the circumstances under which the error occurs.

### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- Ensure that your application is complying with Azure AD best practices to avoid throttling.
- Keep your libraries and SDKs up to date to leverage the latest performance improvements.
  
### Documentation for Guidance:

- Example URL tested: [Microsoft Azure Active Directory Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/). 

### Advice for Data Collection:
- Collect detailed logs from your application, including timestamps, request payloads, and response times.
- Capture relevant network traces if possible (using tools like Fiddler or Wireshark) to analyze request behaviors leading up to the timeout.
- Document the conditions under which the error appears, including the specific API calls being made and the corresponding Azure AD response times.

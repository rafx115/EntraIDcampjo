## Troubleshooting Steps
Error code AADSTS90024 with the description "RequestBudgetExceededError - A transient error has occurred. Try again." is related to the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) service. This error occurs when the request budget for a specific operation has been exceeded, causing the operation to fail temporarily. Here is a detailed troubleshooting guide to address this issue:

### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Verify the Error**: Confirm that the error code is indeed AADSTS90024 with the description RequestBudgetExceededError.
2. **Check Service Status**: Validate the status of Azure AD services to ensure there are no ongoing outages or maintenance that could be causing the issue.

### Common Issues that Cause this Error:
1. **High Volume of Requests**: If there is a sudden spike in the number of requests to Azure AD, it can lead to the request budget being exceeded.
2. **Issues with Resource Management**: Improper management of resources or misconfigured settings can contribute to exceeding the request budget limit.
  
### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Retry Operation**: As the error suggests it is transient, the first step is to retry the operation after waiting for a brief period.
2. **Optimize Requests**: Review the application's functionality to minimize the number of unnecessary requests being made to Azure AD.
3. **Check Service Limits**: Ensure that you are not hitting any limitations imposed by Azure AD in terms of the number of requests allowed.
4. **Throttle Requests**: Implement request throttling mechanisms in your application to prevent overwhelming Azure AD with a large number of requests.
  
### Additional Notes or Considerations:
1. **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of the number of requests being made to Azure AD and set up appropriate monitoring to detect any potential spikes.
2. **Review Code**: Check the code that interacts with Azure AD to identify any areas where optimizations or improvements can be made to reduce the number of requests.
3. **Contact Support**: If the issue persists or if you suspect there might be an underlying problem with Azure AD services, consider reaching out to Azure Support for further assistance.

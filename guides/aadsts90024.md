# AADSTS90024: RequestBudgetExceededError - A transient error has occurred. Try again.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS90024

#### Overview:
The error code `AADSTS90024` indicates a transient error related to Request Budget Limits in Azure Active Directory (AAD). This typically occurs when there are too many requests being sent in a short time frame from a client, leading to what is termed a "Request Budget Exceeded" state. 

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Verify Occurrence**: Determine if the error occurs consistently or intermittently. If it is sporadic, it might truly be a transient error.
2. **Check Other Services**: Ensure that other Azure services and AAD are functioning normally to rule out a broader service issue.
3. **Gather User Context**: Collect information about the user or process that is triggering the error (username, application used, etc.).
4. **Identify Timeframe**: Note the time of occurrence and frequency of requests being made during that period.

#### Common Issues that Cause this Error:
1. **Rate Limiting**: AAD imposes limits on how many requests can be made in a given timeframe. If your application is sending requests above this threshold, youâ€™ll encounter this error.
2. **Application Misconfiguration**: Applications configured to make excessive authentication requests may hit this error.
3. **Increased Load**: Systems experiencing unexpected user spikes or increased request loads can inadvertently exceed these limits.
4. **Association with Retry Logic**: Applications with aggressive retry logic can exacerbate the problem by rapidly resending failed requests.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Implement Exponential Backoff**:
   - If your application is receiving this error, implement exponential backoff to slow down retry attempts when the error occurs. This allows the service time to recover.

2. **Optimize Request Logic**:
   - Reduce the frequency of requests being sent. Batch requests where possible and avoid redundant authentication calls.

3. **Monitor Usage Patterns**:
   - Utilize logging and monitoring to better understand the volume of AAD requests your application makes within specific periods.

4. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - Design your application to handle this error gracefully, such as displaying a user-friendly message or an alternative workflow when authentication fails.

5. **Review Application Configuration**:
   - Ensure that your application is correctly configured for authentication and not making excessive requests due to misconfiguration.

6. **Contact Support**:
   - If this error persists and cannot be resolved by the above methods, consider reaching out to Microsoft support with detailed logs and usage statistics.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- This error can often resolve itself due to its transient nature. However, monitor the frequency and conditions under which it arises.
- Consider implementing monitoring tools or dashboards that can alert you when this issue begins to occur significantly.

#### Documentation Resources:
- **Azure AD Rate Limits**: [Azure Active Directory Limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-application-limits)
- **Authentication Best Practices**: [Authentication and Authorization in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)
- **Exponential Backoff Pattern**: [Exponential Backoff](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/exponential-backoff)

#### Advice for Data Collection:
- **Event Viewer Logs**: Check the application and system logs in the Event Viewer for related error messages under applications interacting with AAD.
- **Network Tracing with NetTrace**: Use NetTrace or other network tracing tools to capture the requests and responses sent to AAD to analyze the failure points and rate of successful vs. failed requests.
- **Fiddler Monitoring**: Utilize Fiddler as a proxy to capture HTTP traffic between your application and Azure services for a deeper look into failed requests and their response codes.

By following this guide, you should be able to diagnose and mitigate issues related to the AADSTS90024 error effectively.

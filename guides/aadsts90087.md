### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check the Error Message:**
   - Review the full error message for context. It may provide specific details or clues about the issue.

2. **Identify the Userâ€™s Context:**
   - Determine if this error occurs for a specific user or multiple users.
   - Verify if the issue occurs for specific applications or across the organization.

3. **Confirm Network Connectivity:**
   - Ensure the client system has network connectivity and can reach Azure AD endpoints.

4. **Gather Logs:**
   - Collect any logs from the Identity Provider (IdP) and the application or service encountering the issue. Logs can provide insight into the specific failure.

### Common Issues That Cause AADSTS90087

1. **Incorrect or Malformed URIs:**
   - Check if the URI being used in the request is correctly formatted and properly matches the expected format in the Azure AD configuration.

2. **Misconfigured Application Registration:**
   - Ensure the application is correctly registered in Azure AD, and all necessary permissions and identifiers (e.g. Reply URLs, Redirect URIs) are correctly set up.

3. **Federation Metadata Issues:**
   - Issues with federation metadata could prevent correct message processing. Ensure that federation metadata is accessible and valid.

4. **Service Principal Name (SPN) Issues:**
   - If using a Service Account, ensure the SPN is correctly configured and permissions are granted as necessary.

5. **Policy Restrictions:**
   - Verify that any conditional access policies or identity protection policies don't inadvertently block the authentication.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Review and Validate the URI:**
   - Double-check the URI being used in the WS-Federation message for correctness. Ensure it aligns with the configured URIs in Azure AD.

2. **Check Azure AD Application Registration:**
   - Log in to the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory > App registrations**.
   - Locate the affected application and verify the settings, especially:
     - Application (client) ID
     - Directory (tenant) ID
     - Reply URLs/Redirect URIs

3. **Verify Federation Metadata:**
   - Ensure that the federation metadata can be retrieved and is valid.
   - You can access the federation metadata endpoint to inspect its contents.

4. **Analyze Authentication Logs:**
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory > Sign-ins**.
   - Review the logs for any failed sign-in attempts to identify specific error messages or codes.

5. **Adjust Policies (if applicable):**
   - Check conditional access settings under **Azure Active Directory > Security > Conditional Access** to ensure that there are no restrictions preventing the login process.

6. **Consult Documentation:**
   - Refer to the official Azure documentation for WS-Federation and Azure AD configuration for more detailed guidance. Key sections may include:
     - [Configure WS-Federation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-wsfederation)
     - [Application Registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Test URL and Metadata Accessibility:**
  - Use tools such as `curl` or web browsers to ensure the metadata and specific endpoints are reachable from the network location of the user.

- **Consult Azure Support:**
  - If the issue persists, consider raising a ticket with Azure support for deeper investigation, especially if this is impacting production environments.

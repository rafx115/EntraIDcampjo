# AADSTS700016: UnauthorizedClient_DoesNotMatchRequest - The application wasn't found in the directory/tenant. This can happen if the application has not been installed by the administrator of the tenant or consented to by any user in the tenant. You might have misconfigured the identifier value for the application or sent your authentication request to the wrong tenant.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS700016: UnauthorizedClient_DoesNotMatchRequest

The AADSTS700016 error code indicates that there is a problem with how the application is configured in Azure Active Directory (AAD) or the request being made to AAD. Below is a comprehensive guide to diagnosing and resolving this issue.

---

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Identify the Application**: Determine which application is causing the error. Verify the application ID (Client ID) associated with the request.
   
2. **Check the Authentication Request**: Inspect the authentication request to ensure it's being sent to the correct tenant and includes the right parameters.

3. **Review the Error Message**: Note the exact wording of the error message, which can provide clues about the source of the problem.

4. **Tenant Information**: Confirm which Azure AD tenant the user or application is associated with and make sure it matches the one being used in the authentication request.

---

#### Common Issues Causing AADSTS700016:
1. **Incorrect Application ID**: The application ID provided in the authentication request does not match any registered applications in the Azure AD tenant.

2. **Misconfigured Redirect URI**: The redirect URI registered in Azure AD does not match the one used in the authentication request.

3. **Missing Application Registration**: The application has not been registered in the Azure AD tenant.

4. **Permission Issues**: The application may not have the necessary permissions granted by the administrator.

5. **Consent Issues**: No user in the tenant has consented to the application.

6. **Multi-Tenant Misconfiguration**: If the application is a multi-tenant application, ensure it's configured correctly to allow access from other tenants.

---

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **Verify Application Registration**:
   - Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to "Azure Active Directory" > "App registrations".
   - Confirm that the application appears in the list and that the Application (client) ID matches what is being used in the request.

2. **Check Application Identifier**:
   - In the Azure Portal, confirm that the application ID (Client ID) used in the request matches the registered application's ID.

3. **Validate Redirect URI**:
   - In the Azure Portal, go to the registered application and check the "Authentication" blade.
   - Ensure that the Redirect URIs match the one being used in the authentication request.

4. **Review Tenant Information**:
   - Ensure the authentication request is targeting the correct tenant by validating the tenant ID in the request.

5. **Check API Permissions**:
   - In the app's registration, navigate to "API permissions".
   - Confirm that the required permissions are listed and consented to by either an admin or a user.

6. **Consider User Consent**:
   - Ensure that either the administrator has consented to the application for all users or individual users have consented as necessary.

7. **If Multi-Tenant**, ensure that:
   - The application is configured in a way that allows multi-tenant access if that's required.

8. **Testing**:
   - Use tools like Postman or similar to recreate the authentication request while verifying the parameters are correct.

#### Additional Notes/Considerations:
- If the application is registered correctly and the identifiers are accurate, consider checking if there are any conditional access policies that might block access.
- Monitor any recent changes made to the application settings or Azure AD that could have inadvertently caused the issue.

#### Documentation for Guidance:
- **Microsoft Identity Platform Documentation**: [Authentication and authorization basics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)
- **Azure AD App Registration**: [Register an application with Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)
- **API Permissions**: [Configure permissions for an app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent)

#### Advice for Data Collection:
1. **Event Viewer Logs**: Check the Event Viewer on the client machine (local or server) under Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > AAD. Any relevant logs can help diagnose issues.

2. **Network Tracing**:
   - Use **Fiddler** or **Nettrace** to capture and inspect HTTP requests and responses. 
   - Look for the `AADSTS700016` error code in the responses to verify if the requests are correct.

3. **Error Messages**: Gather detailed error messages or codes returned from AAD when attempting the authentication. This can help pinpoint the specific misconfiguration.

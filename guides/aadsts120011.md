# AADSTS120011: PasswordChangeAsyncUpnInferenceFailed


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! When dealing with the Azure Active Directory Service error code AADSTS120011, along with the description "PasswordChangeAsyncUpnInferenceFailed", it is crucial to approach troubleshooting in a systematic manner.

### Detailed Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS120011

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Identify the scenario**: Determine under which circumstances the error is being encountered (e.g., during password reset, login attempts, etc.).
2. **Collect User Information**: Gather details about the user experiencing the issue, including their username, user principal name (UPN), and any recent changes to their account.
3. **Check Service Status**: Verify if there are any known service outages or issues with Azure AD at the [Azure Status page](https://status.azure.com/en-us/status).

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error:
1. **UPN Configuration Issues**: The user's UPN may not be correctly configured in Azure AD, especially if the userâ€™s primary domain differs from the tenant domain.
2. **Domain Name Change**: If a user was migrated from one domain to another but their UPN was not updated appropriately, it could lead to issues with password changes.
3. **Sync Issues**: Problems with Azure AD Connect synchronization may result in user account discrepancies, leading to this error.
4. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Any issues with MFA might prevent the password change process.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Verify User UPN**:
   - Log in to the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to "Azure Active Directory" > "Users".
   - Locate the user and verify their UPN and other attributes.

2. **Check Domain Configuration**:
   - Ensure that all required domains are verified in Azure AD.
   - Go to "Azure Active Directory" > "Custom domain names" and check the status of all domains.

3. **Review Azure AD Connect Configuration**:
   - Check if Azure AD Connect is functioning properly.
   - Verify that the UPNs are being synced correctly.
   - Investigate if there are any synchronization conflicts.

4. **Testing Password Change**:
   - Try a password change using different methods, including:
     - Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR).
     - Admin-initiated password change via the Azure portal.
   - Observe if the error persists in different methods.

5. **Examine Logs**:
   - Look into AAD sign-in logs for any specific error messages related to the user's sign-in attempts.

6. **Check MFA settings**:
   - If MFA is enabled, confirm that it is configured correctly and that users have the necessary methods set up.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- Ensure that the user account is not locked or disabled.
- If using self-service features, confirm the user is eligible and the SSPR feature is properly configured.
- Check if any recent changes had been made to user permissions or roles.

#### Documentation for Guidance:
- Microsoft has extensive documentation on managing Azure Active Directory and troubleshooting sign-in issues:
  - [Azure Active Directory password reset](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-sspr-howitworks)
  - [Troubleshoot Microsoft Azure Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/troubleshoot)
  - [Azure AD Connect: Troubleshooting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/tshoot-connect)

#### Advice for Data Collection:
- **Event Viewer Logs**: On Windows servers, use the Event Viewer to collect logs related to Azure AD Connect or any errors on Windows components dealing with authentication.
- **NetMon or NetTrace**: Capture packets during the authentication process to inspect traffic and responses from Azure AD.
- **Fiddler**: Use Fiddler to log HTTP requests and responses if there's a web-based application involved, looking specifically at the authentication calls made to Azure AD.

By following this troubleshooting guide, you should be able to diagnose and resolve issues pertaining to AADSTS120011 effectively. If the problem persists after going through these steps, consider reaching out to Azure support for more in-depth assistance.

## Troubleshooting Steps
**Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS120011 Error: PasswordChangeAsyncUpnInferenceFailed**

**Description:**
Error code AADSTS120011 with the description "PasswordChangeAsyncUpnInferenceFailed" typically occurs in Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication scenarios when there is an issue with password change functionality related to user principal name (UPN) inference.

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:**
1. **Confirm Error Context:** Ensure that the error consistently appears during specific operations such as password change attempts.
2. **Check User UPN:** Verify that the affected user's UPN is correctly configured and matches their identity in the Azure AD.
3. **Review Recent Changes:** Identify any recent changes or configurations that may have triggered the error.

**Common Issues:**
1. **Incorrect or Missing UPN Mapping:** Improper mapping of the user's UPN can lead to UPN inference failure.
2. **Password Policy Restriction:** Password complexity requirements or policies that conflict with the UPN may cause issues.
3. **Network or Service Connectivity:** Temporary network interruptions can impact the password change process in Azure AD.
4. **Inconsistent User Data:** Discrepancies or inaccuracies in user data can result in UPN inference failures.

**Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:**
1. **Ensure UPN Configuration:** Check and update the user's UPN to match their identity and ensure mapping correctness.
2. **Review Password Policy:** Adjust the password complexity and policy settings to align with the UPN requirements.
3. **Verify Network Connectivity:** Ensure stable network connectivity to avoid interruptions during the password change process.
4. **Sync User Data:** Synchronize user data across systems to prevent discrepancies that could affect UPN inference.
5. **Try Alternative UPN Inference Methods:** Explore different methods of UPN inference within Azure AD to find a suitable approach.
6. **Contact Support:** If the issue persists, contact Microsoft support for further assistance and troubleshooting.

**Additional Notes or Considerations:**
- **Monitor Logs:** Review Azure AD logs for detailed error messages and insights into the UPN inference failure.
- **Testing Environment:** Consider testing UPN inference changes in a non-production environment before applying to production.
- **Regular Maintenance:** Update and maintain UPN mappings and configurations periodically to prevent similar issues in the future.

**Documentation for Guidance:**
- Detailed guidance and documentation on troubleshooting Azure AD issues, including UPN inference problems, can be found in the Microsoft Azure Active Directory documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis). Specific troubleshooting steps for error code AADSTS120011 may also be available in the Azure AD documentation or support resources.

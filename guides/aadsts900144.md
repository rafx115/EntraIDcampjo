# AADSTS900144: The request body must contain the following parameter: '{name}'. Developer error - the app is attempting to sign in without the necessary or correct authentication parameters.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS900144 Error Code

#### Error Description:
The error code AADSTS900144 indicates that the request body is missing a required parameter, specifically '{name}'. This is usually due to a developer error where the app is attempting to sign in without the necessary or correct authentication parameters.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Verify Application Configuration**: Check the application configuration in the Azure portal to ensure all required parameters are properly set.
2. **Review Code Implementation**: Examine the code in the app that handles authentication to pinpoint any missing or incorrect parameters.

#### Common Issues:
1. **Missing Scopes**: App does not include all required authentication scopes.
2. **Incorrect Redirect URIs**: Mismatch between redirect URIs in app registration and code implementation.
3. **Invalid ClientID or ClientSecret**: Incorrect application identifiers provided in the authentication request.
4. **Tokens Expiry**: Access or refresh tokens expired causing authentication failures.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Check Scopes and Permissions**:
   - Ensure that the app is requesting all necessary scopes in the authentication request.
   - Review Azure AD documentation on how to set scopes: [Azure AD Scopes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/scopes-best-practices)

2. **Verify Redirect URIs**:
   - Confirm that the redirect URIs registered in the app configuration match the URIs specified in the authentication request.
   - Refer to the Microsoft Docs for setting redirect URIs: [Redirect URIs in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reply-url)

3. **Check ClientID and ClientSecret**:
   - Ensure that the client ID and client secret used in the authentication request are correct and correspond to the registered app.
   - Documentation on registering apps in Azure AD: [Registering Applications in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)

4. **Manage Token Expiry**:
   - Implement token management to handle token expiry gracefully and request new tokens when needed.
   - Explore token lifetimes and renewal strategies in Azure AD: [Token Lifetime Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/silent-authentication)

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- It's crucial to thoroughly review the app's code and Azure AD configuration to identify the root cause of the error.
- Regularly monitor Azure AD logs for additional insights into authentication failures and errors.

#### Documentation for Guidance:
- For detailed guidance on Azure AD authentication, refer to the official Microsoft Azure AD documentation: [Azure Active Directory Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/)
- Microsoft's documentation provides comprehensive resources and examples to troubleshoot authentication issues effectively.

# AADSTS900144: The request body must contain the following parameter: '{name}'. Developer error - the app is attempting to sign in without the necessary or correct authentication parameters.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! This troubleshooting guide will help you address the AADSTS900144 error code encountered during the authentication process with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). The error indicates a deficiency in the request parameters required for successful sign-in.

### AADSTS900144 Troubleshooting Guide

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Review Error Message**: Carefully read the full error message, which contains the specifics of the missing parameter.
2. **Check Application Logs**: Look for any logs related to the authentication process from your application to gather context around the error occurrence.
3. **Validate API Endpoint**: Confirm that the endpoint you are calling for authentication is correct and that there are no typos.
4. **Inspect Request Body**: Capture and analyze the request body that is being sent to Azure AD. It should include all required parameters.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error

- **Missing Required Parameters**: The request body lacks one or more required parameters, such as `client_id`, `scope`, `redirect_uri`, etc.
- **Incorrect Parameter Values**: The parameters are present but contain incorrect values or types.
- **App Registration Issues**: The Azure AD app registration is misconfigured or permissions are not granted properly.
- **Network Issues**: Network-related issues that prevent your app from communicating properly with Azure AD.
- **Token Endpoint vs Authorization Endpoint**: Ensuring the correct endpoint is being called (authorization vs token).

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify the Request Body**:
   - Ensure the request payload includes all required attributes. For Microsoft identity platform V2.0, the minimum required parameters typically include:
     - `client_id`
     - `scope`
     - `grant_type`
     - `redirect_uri`
   - Ensure the parameters are spelled correctly.

2. **Check App Registration**:
   - Go to the Azure Portal.
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations**.
   - Select your application and review its configuration:
     - Confirm `Redirect URIs` are accurate.
     - Validate API permissions.
     - Ensure you're using the correct `client_id`.

3. **Test API Call**:
   - Use tools like Postman to mimic the authentication request.
   - Construct your request body correctly and test the endpoint independently.

4. **Review Documentation**:
   - Refer to Microsoft’s documentation for details on required parameters:
     - [Microsoft Identity Platform and OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow)
     - [Microsoft Identity Platform and OAuth 2.0 Token Response](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#token-response)

5. **Configuration in Code**:
   - If you are using a library (e.g., MSAL), ensure you are using it correctly according to the library's guidelines. 
   
#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Check for Typos**: Small errors in parameter names can lead to big issues, double-check for typographical errors.
- **Network Firewalls or Proxies**: Ensure that your requests are not being blocked by firewalls or proxies that might prevent communication to Azure AD.

#### Documentation for Guidance

- Here are links to relevant Microsoft documentation:
   - [Microsoft Identity Platform V2.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview)
   - [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749)
   - [Application Permissions in Azure AD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-app-permissions)

#### Testing Documentation Reachability

- Verify the links provided above are reachable by entering them into your web browser.
- Ensure that they direct to the appropriate documentation pages without error.

#### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Logs**: Collect application logs before and after the error occurs to capture the context.
2. **HTTP Requests**: Capture network requests to see the exact payload being sent and the responses received.
3. **Configuration Files**: Document and collect your app registration configurations.
4. **Environment Details**: Note down the environment details — SDK versions, programming languages, dependency versions, etc.

By following these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to identify the root cause of the AADSTS900144 error and apply the appropriate resolution. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Microsoft support for more in-depth assistance.

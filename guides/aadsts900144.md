# AADSTS900144: The request body must contain the following parameter: '{name}'. Developer error - the app is attempting to sign in without the necessary or correct authentication parameters.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS900144

The error code AADSTS900144 indicates that there is an issue with the request parameters during the authentication process with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). It's essential to ensure that all necessary parameters are correctly configured and passed with the authentication request.

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify the Context**: Determine where the error occurs. Is it during an application sign-in, a federated login, or while accessing an API?
  
2. **Check the Request**:
   - Inspect the parameters being sent in the request.
   - Ensure the request body contains all required authentication fields.

3. **Logging**: Check any available logs for detailed error messages that might provide more context.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Missing Required Parameters**: The request is missing essential parameters such as `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `scope`, etc.
  
2. **Incorrect Client Configuration**: The application may not be properly registered in the Azure AD portal or may have misconfigured settings.
  
3. **Invalid OAuth Flow**: The application may be using an incorrect flow for the scenario (e.g., using authorization code flow when implicit flow is expected).

4. **Mismatched Redirect URI**: The redirect URI in the request does not match the one registered in Azure AD.

5. **Outdated SDK/Library**: The libraries or SDKs used may be outdated and not fully support the latest authentication standards.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

#### Step 1: Verify the Application Registration

- **Azure Portal Check**:
  - Go to the Azure Portal.
  - Navigate to "Azure Active Directory" â†’ "App registrations".
  - Find your application and open its settings.

- **Check API permissions**: Ensure that the necessary permissions are granted.
- **Check Redirect URIs**: Verify that the redirect URIs listed match what you are using in your request.

#### Step 2: Inspect the Authentication Request

- Use tools like Postman or Fiddler to check the request being sent.
- Ensure all required parameters are present:
  - `client_id`
  - `client_secret` (if applicable)
  - `scope`
  - `redirect_uri`
  - `response_type`
- Ensure that the parameters are correctly encoded in the request.

#### Step 3: Review Application Code

- Check the code handling the sign-in process.
- Ensure that the authentication library being used (e.g., MSAL, ADAL) is up to date.
- Look for hardcoded strings or environment variables that may provide incorrect or missing values.

#### Step 4: Check Application Permissions

- Ensure that the user has the correct permissions to access the resources. This could involve user consent or admin consent for certain permissions.

#### Step 5: Test Different Scenarios

- Try logging in with a different user account to rule out account-specific issues.
- Test different authentication methods (like using a different flow).

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Caching**: If you have recently made changes, ensure you clear any cached tokens or tokens stored in your application to prevent using outdated tokens.
- **Environment**: Make sure that your testing environment properly mirrors your production setup, especially in terms of application registrations and permissions.

### Advice for Data Collection

To effectively troubleshoot the issue, you may want to collect logs and traces:

1. **Event Viewer Logs**: 
   - On your server or development machine, check Windows Event Logs for any relevant authentication errors.

2. **Network Tracing**:
   - Use **nettrace** or Fiddler to capture HTTP requests when attempting to authenticate. Look for any discrepancies or missing parameters in the request.

3. **Debugging Code**: 
   - Consider adding logging within your application code to show what parameters are being passed at runtime. This can help pinpoint where the request is failing.

By following these steps and thoroughly reviewing the application's configuration and requests, you should be able to resolve the AADSTS900144 error.

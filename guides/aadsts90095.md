### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Confirm User Permissions:**

2. **Examine Application Permissions:**

   - Locate the application in question and check under "API permissions" to see what permissions are requested.
   - Ensure that permissions marked as "requires admin consent" are listed.

3. **Request Admin Consent:**
   - If the user requires admin consent, they should notify their administrator.
   - As an admin, navigate to the Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > App registrations > your app > API permissions > Grant admin consent for [Tenant Name].

4. **Review Application Registration:**
   - Check the application properties under Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > App registrations:
     - Verify Redirect URIs and application ID.
     - Ensure that required permissions are precisely set.

5. **Check Conditional Access Policies:**

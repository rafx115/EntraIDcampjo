# AADSTS50076: UserStrongAuthClientAuthNRequired - Due to a configuration change made by the admin such as a Conditional Access policy, per-user enforcement, or because you moved to a new location, the user must use multifactor authentication to access the resource. Retry with a new authorize request for the resource.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50076 Error Code

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Confirm the Error**: Make sure the error message specifically mentions AADSTS50076 with the UserStrongAuthClientAuthNRequired description.
2. **Identify User**: Ensure you know which user account is experiencing the issue.
3. **Check Admin Configuration Changes**: Verify if any recent changes have been made by the admin, such as implementing Conditional Access policies or per-user enforcement.
4. **Review Location Changes**: Determine if the user has recently moved to a new location or is accessing the resource from an unfamiliar location.

#### Common Issues:
1. **Conditional Access Policies**: Admins may have enabled policies that require users to perform multi-factor authentication based on specific conditions.
2. **Per-User Enforcement**: This setting might have been adjusted to mandate MFA for certain users.
3. **Location-Based Policies**: Policies that enforce MFA based on the user's current location can trigger this error.
4. **Recent User Travel**: If the user has traveled recently and is trying to access the resource from a new location, MFA might be required.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Inform User**: Notify the user about the need for multi-factor authentication to access the resource.
2. **Attempt Login**: Have the user attempt logging in again to trigger the MFA prompt.
3. **Complete MFA Process**: Guide the user through the multi-factor authentication process if they encounter it during login.
4. **Check MFA Methods**: Ensure the user has access to the required MFA methods (e.g., Authenticator app, SMS, phone call).
5. **Admin Configuration**: If you are an administrator, review and adjust Conditional Access policies or per-user settings to alleviate the MFA requirement if necessary.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- **User Training**: Provide users with training or documentation on how to navigate multi-factor authentication processes.
- **Admin Awareness**: Keep admins informed about the impact of configuration changes on user authentication requirements.
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review and adjust Conditional Access policies based on organizational needs and feedback.

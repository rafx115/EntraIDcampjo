# AADSTS50076: UserStrongAuthClientAuthNRequired - Due to a configuration change made by the admin such as a Conditional Access policy, per-user enforcement, or because you moved to a new location, the user must use multifactor authentication to access the resource. Retry with a new authorize request for the resource.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Hereâ€™s a detailed troubleshooting guide for the error code AADSTS50076, which indicates that the user is required to perform multifactor authentication (MFA) due to various configuration changes or policies enforced by the admin.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50076

---

#### **1. Initial Diagnostic Steps**

1. **User Identification**:
   - Identify the user experiencing the error. Gather their username (UPN) and note the time of the incident.

2. **Check Azure AD Sign-in Logs**:
   - Navigate to the Azure Active Directory (AAD) portal.
   - Go to "Sign-ins" under "Monitoring" to review logs for failed attempts associated with the user.
   - Look for AADSTS50076 specifically and note any additional error details or patterns.

3. **Determine MFA Status**:
   - Check if the user has MFA enabled in their account settings.
   - Confirm if there are any conditional access policies that require MFA.

#### **2. Common Issues That Cause This Error**

1. **Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Policies enforcing MFA based on specific conditions such as user location, device status, or application being accessed.

2. **Per-User MFA Enforcement**:
   - Per-user settings accidentally enabling or restricting access.

3. **Changes in User Location**:
   - Security measures may flag a new (or unrecognized) location and require MFA.

4. **User Group Membership Changes**:
   - Changes in user roles or group membership may alter their access policies.

5. **Application-Specific Policies**:
   - Certain applications may have distinct requirements set by the administrator.

#### **3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies**

1. **MFA Configuration Check**:
   - Access the Azure portal as an admin.
   - Navigate to Azure Active Directory > Users > Find the user.
   - Ensure that the account has the correct MFA settings configured (either under per-user settings or conditional access policies).

2. **Review Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Go to Azure Active Directory > Security > Conditional Access.
   - Review the policies that may apply to the user (like locations, groups).
   - Confirm the policies and check if they require MFA in certain situations.

3. **User Registration for MFA**:
   - If MFA is required, ensure the user has registered for MFA.
   - Instruct the user to access https://aka.ms/mfasetup to set up their MFA options.

4. **Testing Access**:
   - After adjusting settings, ask the user to attempt to log in again.
   - Ensure they are attempting to access the service from an allowed location or device.

5. **Use a Test Account**:
   - If possible, try to replicate the issue using a test account with similar configuration and test different scenarios.

#### **4. Additional Notes or Considerations**

- Be mindful of any recent changes in company policy or settings that might not yet be communicated to users.
- Ensure users are aware of the need for MFA, especially after IT communicates policy changes.
- Some users may need to clear cache or use an InPrivate or Incognito browser session to remove saved sessions or credentials.

- **Microsoft Documentation on Conditional Access**: 
   - [What is Conditional Access?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview)
   
- **Microsoft Documentation on Enabling MFA**: 
   - [Configure Multi-Factor Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/user-help/multi-factor-authentication-end-user)

#### **6. Advice for Data Collection**

- **Collect Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Check for any relevant logs in the Event Viewer on the client machine, particularly under the "Applications and Services Logs" for any errors that align with the time the incident occurred.

- **Network Trace (NetTrace)**:
   - Use tools like Microsoft Message Analyzer or Wireshark to capture traffic while reproducing the issue to analyze network requests/responses.

- **Fiddler for Web Traffic**:
   - Use Fiddler to troubleshoot web-related issues. This can capture HTTP(S) traffic when a user tries to authenticate. Look for any HTTP error codes or alerts in responses that can give clues about the issue.

Collecting this data can provide insights into underlying connectivity issues, browser issues, or further authentication problems.

# AADSTS5000819: InvalidSamlTokenEmailMissingOrInvalid - SAML Assertion is invalid. Email address claim is missing or doesn't match domain from an external realm.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS5000819 Error

#### Error Overview
**Error Code**: AADSTS5000819  
**Description**: "InvalidSamlTokenEmailMissingOrInvalid - SAML Assertion is invalid. Email address claim is missing or doesn't match domain from an external realm."

This error typically indicates that the SAML assertion being sent alongside the authentication request is not valid because the email address claim is either missing or does not match the expected domain.

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check the SAML Assertion**:
   - Analyze the SAML assertion to ensure that the necessary claims are present.
   - Verify the format and integrity of the SAML token.

2. **Identify the Application**:
   - Determine which application or service is generating this error during the SAML authentication process.

3. **Examine User Details**:
   - Confirm that the user attempting to authenticate has a valid email address set in their profile.
   - Ensure that this email address is within the expected domain.

4. **Gather Event Logs**:
   - Check the event logs for any related authentication events or errors.
   - Review logs related to AAD (Azure Active Directory) for more context on the failed authentication.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Missing Email Claim**:
   - The SAML token does not contain any email address claims.

2. **Invalid Email Format**:
   - The email address claim is formatted incorrectly in the SAML token.

3. **Misconfigured SAML Identity Provider**:
   - The Identity Provider (IdP) might not be configured to send the email claim.

4. **Domain Mismatch**:
   - The email address in the SAML assertion does not match the domain expected by Azure AD.

5. **User Principal Name (UPN) Issues**:
   - The user may not have a user principal name that matches the claim being sent.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify SAML Token Claims**:
   - Use tools like SAML Tracer or Fiddler to capture the SAML request and response.
   - Ensure the SAML assertion includes the necessary claims, specifically the email address claim (often "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress").

2. **Modify Identity Provider Settings**:
   - Access the settings of the IdP and ensure that it is configured to provide the email claim.
   - Confirm that the claim is being sent in the expected format.

3. **Test Domain Configuration**:
   - Verify that the domain of the email claim matches what Azure AD expects.
   - If using multiple domains, ensure the right domain is being used for the user.

4. **User Profile Verification**:
   - Check the user's Azure AD profile to ensure that they have a valid email address.
   - If the email is incorrect, update it in Azure AD.

5. **Refresh and Retry**:
   - After any changes to configurations or user profiles, refresh tokens and attempt to re-authenticate.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Timeouts or Expiration**: Ensure that the SAML token is not expired. Tokens typically contain expiration times.
- **SAML vs OIDC**: Ensure that you're following the right authentication protocol as needed by your application.
- **User Syncing**: If the user is coming from an external realm, ensure that syncing is correctly set up if required.

### Documentation for Guidance

- **Azure AD SAML Token Reference**: [Microsoft Docs - SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-saml-protocol)
- **Identity Provider Configuration**: Consult the specific documentation for the IdP being used (e.g., ADFS, Okta).
- **Claims Mapping in Azure AD**: [Microsoft Identity Platform Claims Mapping](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/claim-based-authentication)

### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Look for events under Applications and Services Logs -> Microsoft -> Windows -> AAD.
   - Review any errors or warnings related to authentication failures.

2. **NetTrace**:
   - Use NetTrace or similar network tracing tools to capture traffic for the SAML authentication process.
   - Analyze the captured packets for any discrepancies in the SAML assertion.

3. **Fiddler Approach**:
   - Use Fiddler to inspect HTTP requests and responses during the SAML authentication.
   - Check the SAML responses in the HTTP response body for claim details.

Remember to gather all necessary logs before any fixes, mention user scenarios, and specify application details for comprehensive troubleshooting.

## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50011: "InvalidReplyTo"

#### Overview
The "AADSTS50011" error indicates that the reply address (redirect URI) provided in the application request is either missing, misconfigured, or doesn't match the one configured in the Azure AD application settings. This error commonly occurs during the authentication process and prevents users from successfully signing in.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify the Application**: Determine which application is experiencing the issue and confirm the URL or redirect URI it is using.
2. **Check the Error Context**: Analyze the error message carefully. Note which URLs were involved in the authentication request that caused the error.
3. **Review User Action**: Understand the process that led to this error. Was the user trying to access a particular resource or application? Is it consistently reproducible or intermittent?

### Common Issues that Cause AADSTS50011 Error
1. **Mismatched Redirect URIs**: The redirect URI specified in the application's authentication request does not match any of the redirect URIs registered in Azure AD.
2. **Missing Redirect URI**: The redirect URI is not included in the application's registration in Azure AD.
3. **Typographical Errors**: There may be typos or incorrect formatting in the registered redirect URIs (e.g., http versus https, trailing slashes).
4. **Scope Changes**: If the application scopes are modified without updating the redirect URIs, it could lead to unauthorized requests.
5. **Environment-Specific URIs**: Sometimes, different environments (development, staging, production) use different redirect URIs, leading to discrepancies based on where the request is coming from.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Access Microsoft Entra (Azure AD)**:
   - Log in to the Azure portal (`https://portal.azure.com`).
   - Navigate to `Azure Active Directory`.

2. **Locate the Application**:
   - Go to `App registrations` and search for the application experiencing the error.

3. **Review Redirect URIs**:
   - Click on the application to access its settings.
   - Under `Authentication`, review the list of redirect URIs configured for the application.

4. **Edit Redirect URI**:
   - If necessary, ensure that the required redirect URI (matching what was sent in the request) is added to this list.
   - Add any missing redirect URIs by clicking `Add a Redirect URI`.
   - Make sure the URI is exact, including any required protocols (http or https).

5. **Validate and Save Changes**:
   - After making changes, save the configuration.
   - Familiarize yourself with any changes to the appâ€™s behavior after saving.

6. **Test the Application**:
   - Retry the authentication process to see if the error has been resolved.

### Additional Notes and Considerations
- **Multi-Tenant Apps**: If your application is multi-tenant, make sure that necessary scopes and redirect URIs are appropriately configured for all tenants.
- **Configuration Validation**: Always validate URLs against a known list of valid URLs to prevent unnecessary errors.

### Advice for Data Collection if Further Issues Arise
- **Event Viewer Logs**: Check application logs in the Event Viewer to look for any related errors.
- **Network Traces**: Use tools like Fiddler or Wireshark to capture network traffic and analyze the OAuth2 calls if necessary.
- **NetTrace**: Collect network traces with `netsh trace` commands if there are persistent issues that are difficult to diagnose.
- **Error Logging**: Make sure your application has robust error logging to capture errors and stack traces.

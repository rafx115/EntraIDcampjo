# AADSTS90010: NotSupported - Unable to create the algorithm.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The AADSTS90010 error code with the description "NotSupported - Unable to create the algorithm" typically indicates an error related to cryptographic operations within Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication processes. Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide to help you diagnose and resolve this issue.

### Detailed Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS90010

---

#### **1. Initial Diagnostic Steps**

- **Identify the Context**: Determine the scenario in which the error occurs (e.g., when attempting to authenticate using a specific application, service, or API).
- **Check User and Application Details**: Verify the user account and application identity involved in the authentication process.
- **Reproduce the Issue**: Try to reproduce the error in different environments if possible (development, staging, production).

---

#### **2. Common Issues That Cause This Error**

- **Unsupported Cryptography Algorithm**: The application may be using cryptographic algorithms not supported by Azure AD.
- **Incorrect Configuration**: Misconfiguration in Azure AD settings related to the authentication flow.
- **Library Compatibility**: Dependency libraries (e.g., JWT libraries) are outdated or incompatible with Azure AD requirements.
- **Identity Security Settings**: Azure AD security settings may restrict specific authentication flows or algorithms.

---

#### **3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies**

**Step 1: Review Application Cryptography Implementation**
- Ensure the application is using supported cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
- Check if using algorithms like SHA-256, RSA, or Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) as supported by Azure AD.

**Step 2: Check Azure AD Configuration**
- Verify the application registration in Azure AD.
- Go to **Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > App registrations > [Your App] > Authentication**.
  
Ensure the authentication methods align with what your application is implementing.

**Step 3: Update Libraries and SDKs**
- Ensure all libraries involved in handling authentication (like Microsoft Identity Client, JWT library, etc.) are updated to their latest versions.

**Step 4: Read Azure AD Security Documentation**
- Check if the Azure AD tenant security configuration is restricting the algorithms being used.

**Step 5: Test with Different Configurations**
- Modify authentication settings temporarily to test if removing/addition of particular configurations resolves the problem.

#### **4. Additional Notes or Considerations**

- **Testing Environment**: Conduct testing in an isolated environment.
- **Service Health**: Check Azure Service Health for any outages related to Azure AD during the troubleshooting period.
- **Documentation Review**: Regularly consult the official Azure documentation for updates or guidance.

#### **5. Documentation and Guidance Sources**

- **Azure AD Authentication**: [Overview of Azure AD Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)
- **Supported Algorithms**: [Supported cryptographic algorithms in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oidc)
- **Troubleshooting Az AD Errors**: [Troubleshoot Azure AD authentication errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/troubleshoot-authentication)

---

#### **6. Advice for Data Collection**

- **Event Viewer Logs**: Collect logs from the **Event Viewer** (Windows logs > Application). Look for any warnings or errors around the time of the authentication attempts.
  
- **Network Tracing**: Use **NetTrace** and capture logs during the authentication flow. Ensure to handle sensitive information securely.
  
- **Fiddler**: Capture HTTP requests made during the authentication process using **Fiddler** to analyze the response codes and payloads returned by Azure AD.

- **Log File Review**: Check the logs generated by your application (if available) for additional error messages or exceptions leading to this error code.

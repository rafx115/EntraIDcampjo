# AADSTS50173: FreshTokenNeeded - The provided grant has expired due to it being revoked, and a fresh auth token is needed. Either an admin or a user revoked the tokens for this user, causing subsequent token refreshes to fail and require reauthentication. Have the user sign in again.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50173 Error

#### Overview
The AADSTS50173 error indicates that the user’s authentication tokens have expired because they were revoked manually by an admin or the user themselves. This requires the user to re-authenticate to obtain fresh tokens for further access.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify the User:**
   - Confirm which user is experiencing the issue and gather their username and related account details.

2. **Check Token Expiry:**
   - Verify the expiration time of the current tokens that were issued to the user when they last authenticated.

3. **Review Recent Changes:**
   - Determine if any changes were made to user permissions, roles, or conditions that may lead to the revocation of tokens.

4. **Examine Logs:**
   - Check system logs for any indication of token revocation events. This can include application logs or Azure AD sign-in logs.

### Common Issues Causing AADSTS50173 Error

1. **Token Revocation:**
   - Tokens can be revoked by either the user through account settings or by an admin for security reasons.

2. **User Account Status:**
   - The user account might be disabled or removed from the Azure Active Directory.

3. **Policy Changes:**
   - Changes in conditional access policies or any security groups affecting the user's access might trigger token revocation.

4. **Manual Sign-Out:**
   - The user signed out from another device, triggering the revocation of refresh tokens.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **User Re-authentication:**
   - Instruct the user to sign out completely and then sign back in. This should initiate a new authentication process and obtain fresh tokens.

2. **Check Admin Portal:**
   - Log in to the Azure Portal and navigate to "Azure Active Directory" > "Users" > select the affected user > "User settings" to verify if tokens were revoked.

3. **Review Conditional Access Policies:**
   - Analyze conditional access policies that might be affecting the user’s authentication by navigating to "Azure Active Directory" > "Security" > "Conditional Access".

4. **Audit Sign-In Logs:**
   - Check the Azure AD sign-in logs to track any revocation events or anomalies. Navigate to "Azure Active Directory" > "Sign-ins".

5. **Reset User Password:**
   - If the user’s credentials are suspected to be compromised, reset their password and ask them to re-authenticate.

6. **Admin Review:**
   - If an admin revoked the tokens knowingly, the admin should confirm whether the revocation was intended or if it can be reverted.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Frequent Issues:** 
  If this error occurs frequently, consider reviewing the organization’s security protocols and token lifetime settings.

- **User Awareness:**
  Make sure users are aware that signing out from any session can affect their tokens.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
  Ensure that MFA settings are correctly configured as they may have implications for token validity.

### Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer Logs, Nettrace, Fiddler)

1. **Event Viewer:**
   - Check the Windows Event Viewer under Applications and Services Logs for any relevant warnings or errors concerning user authentication.

2. **Network Traces:**
   - Use `Nettrace` or `Fiddler` to capture network calls to Azure AD's token endpoint. Check the HTTP responses for explicit error codes or messages that might provide additional context regarding the error.

3. **Gather Fiddler Logs:**
   - If using Fiddler, ensure that you set it up to decrypt HTTPS traffic. Look for calls to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/` and check for errors or status responses.

By following this guide, you should be able to systematically identify and resolve issues related to the AADSTS50173 error.

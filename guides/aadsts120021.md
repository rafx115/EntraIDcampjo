## Troubleshooting Steps
Error Code: AADSTS120021 - PartnerServiceSsprInternalServiceError

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:**
1. **Check Service Status:** Verify if the Azure Active Directory service is functional and not experiencing any disruptions.
2. **Review Recent Changes:** Investigate any recent changes to the Azure AD configuration that might have caused the error.
3. **Check System Logs:** Look for any relevant error messages or logs that can provide more insight into the issue.
4. **Validate Connectivity:** Ensure there are no network connectivity issues between your service and Azure AD.

**Common Issues:**
1. **Service Outage:** Azure AD service might be temporarily down, causing this internal server error.
2. **Misconfiguration:** Incorrect settings or configurations within Azure AD might lead to this error.
3. **Credential Issues:** Invalid or expired credentials used in the authentication process can trigger this error.

**Step-by-step Resolution Strategies:**
1. **Check Azure AD Service Status:**
   - Go to the Azure Status page (status.azure.com) to check if there are any ongoing outages or incidents affecting Azure AD.
   - If there is a service disruption, wait for Microsoft to resolve it.

2. **Review Azure AD Configuration:**
   - Verify all configurations in Azure AD such as applications, permissions, and settings are correctly set up.
   - Ensure that any recent changes have not inadvertently caused the error.

3. **Check Credential Validity:**
   - Ensure that the credentials used for authentication are valid and not expired.
   - Update the credentials if needed and retry the operation.

4. **Contact Azure Support:**
   - If the issue persists despite checking the above steps, consider contacting Azure Support for further assistance.

**Additional Notes or Considerations:**
- This error code indicates an internal service error, meaning the root cause is likely on the Azure AD side rather than within your application.
- Regularly monitor the Azure AD status page and keep updated on any service notifications that might impact your operations.

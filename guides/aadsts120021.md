---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check Azure Service Health:**
   - Visit the Azure Service Health dashboard to see if there are any known outages or issues related to Azure Active Directory or its services.

2. **Verify User Credentials:**
   - Ensure that the user credentials are correct and that the user is correctly registered for SSPR.

3. **Review Service Configurations:**
   - Confirm that SSPR is enabled in the Azure portal for the respective user or group.

4. **Check for Account Issues:**
   - Look for issues in the user's account, such as being locked, disabled, or if multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Service Outages:**
   - Temporary issues with Azure services that can cause SSPR to fail.

2. **Configuration Errors:**
   - Misconfigurations in SSPR settings in Azure AD.

3. **Network Issues:**
   - Client-side or network issues that cause service requests to fail.

4. **User Registration Issues:**
   - Users might not be registered correctly for SSPR or may not have the required authentication methods set up.

5. **Tenant-specific Issues:**
   - Issues specific to the Azure AD tenant that may affect SSPR functionality.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Check Azure Service Health:**
   - Navigate to the Azure portal, and then to **Service Health** to ensure there are no outages affecting the Azure AD service.

2. **Validate SSPR Settings:**
   - In Azure AD, go to **Users > User settings > Password reset** to ensure SSPR is enabled for users or groups as needed.

3. **Review User's SSPR Registration:**
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to **Users > All users > [select user] > Authentication methods** and check if the user has registered at least one method for SSPR.

4. **Test Different Networks:**
   - Verify if the error persists on different networks or devices to rule out network issues.

5. **Audit Logs:**
   - Check Azure AD logs for any audit logs that might give more information on error occurrence. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory > Audit logs**.

6. **Contact Microsoft Support:**
   - If the issue persists after all checks and configurations, consider raising a support ticket with Microsoft for detailed troubleshooting.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Always use the most recent browser and clear cache/cookies that might affect service functionality.
- Be aware of the configuration and policies set forth in your tenant that could restrict SSPR functionalities.

### Documentation for Guidance

- Microsoft Docs: [Self-service password reset in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-sspr-howitworks)
- Microsoft Docs: [Monitor Azure Active Directory service health](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-monitoring)

### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - On the userâ€™s machine, open Event Viewer (type `eventvwr` in the Run dialog), and check under **Windows Logs > Application** for any errors relating to Azure AD or MDM/Intune which may have additional insights.

2. **Network Tracing:**
   - Use `nettrace` to capture the networking stack's behavior when the error occurs. This can help identify connectivity issues or failures in requests sent to Azure.

3. **Fiddler:**
   - Fiddler can be used to analyze HTTP requests/responses when performing SSPR actions. Check for responses that may indicate failure points.

Engaging in these data collection methods will assist in providing a clear picture of the issue for support teams both internally and if escalation to Microsoft support is necessary.

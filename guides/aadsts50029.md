## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS50029

**Error Description:**
- The error code AADSTS50029 indicates that the URI being used contains characters that are deemed invalid. This can occur when the domain name provided does not meet the standards for valid characters and formats.

### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps

Begin with the following diagnostic steps:

- **Identify the Context**: Determine where the error occurred (e.g., application, web portal, or during an API call).
- **Check the URI**: Review the exact URI that is triggering the error message. Verify the domain name and path in the URI.
- **Verify User Info**: Ensure that the user attempting to authenticate has the appropriate permissions and rights in Azure Active Directory (AAD).
- **Contact Info**: Confirm if the user or application is associated with the proper Azure AD tenant.

### 2. Common Issues That Cause This Error

Several typical issues can lead to this error:

- **Invalid Characters**: The domain may contain special characters or spaces that aren't permitted (e.g., underscores `_`, spaces).
- **Improper Domain Formats**: The URI might not follow the correct format (e.g., not including `.com`, `.org`, etc.), or may have incorrect casing.
- **DNS Issues**: The URI may point to a non-resolvable domain name.
- **Application Registration Issues**: The application may not be properly registered in Azure AD.

### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

#### Step 1: Review and Correct the URI

- **Inspection**: Examine the URI that’s being used carefully.
- **Validation**: Validate the domain name format against the following criteria:
  - Should only use valid domain characters (letters, numbers, periods, and hyphens).
  - Avoid spaces and unsupported characters.
  
#### Step 2: Check Application Registration

- **Go to Azure Portal**: Log in to the Azure portal.
- **Navigate to Azure Active Directory**: Find "Registered applications" under Azure AD.
- **Select the relevant application**: Confirm that the redirect URIs and application configurations are properly set.
- **Correct any issues**: Update the URIs if they contain invalid characters or formats.

#### Step 3: Verify DNS Configuration

- Confirm that the domain name specified in the URI is a valid and active domain.
- Use tools like `nslookup` or `ping` to verify the domain’s resolve-ability.

#### Step 4: Consult Tenant Administrator

- If the earlier steps do not resolve the issue, escalate the problem to the Azure AD tenant administrator. They may see settings or configurations not visible to you.

### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Cache Issues**: Sometimes browsers cache invalid redirects or URIs. Clear the browser cache and try again.
- **Environment Context**: Ensure that the same error isn’t masked in a different context (e.g., development vs. production).

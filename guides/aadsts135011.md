# AADSTS135011: Device used during the authentication is disabled.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS135011

#### Overview
Error code **AADSTS135011** indicates that the device used during the authentication process is disabled. This issue often arises in environments where conditional access policies or device compliance are enforced within Azure AD.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Gather User Information:**
   - Confirm the identity of the user experiencing the issue, including their username and any relevant account information.
   
2. **Identify Device Details:**
   - Document the device type, operating system, and version.
   - Determine how the user is attempting to authenticate (e.g., via a web app, desktop application, etc.).

3. **Check User Authentication Logs:**
   - Review Azure AD sign-in logs to gather information about the failed authentication attempts for the affected user.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Device Compliance:**
   - The device may not comply with the organization's security policies.

2. **Disabled Device:**
   - The device may have been manually disabled in Azure AD.

3. **Conditional Access Policies:**
   - There might be conditional access policies applied that require devices to meet specific criteria (e.g., managed devices, compliant devices).

4. **Intune Configuration:**
   - If using Intune, the device may not be properly enrolled, or its status might indicate a compliance issue.

5. **Account Issues:**
   - The user account might have issues that need to be resolved, such as being disabled or having an expired password.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Check Device Status in Azure AD:**
   - In Azure AD, navigate to **Devices**.
   - Search for the device in question and check its status. If it is marked as "disabled," you will need to re-enable it.

2. **Review Conditional Access Policies:**
   - Go to the **Azure AD** portal, navigate to **Security** > **Conditional Access**.
   - Review relevant policies impacting the userâ€™s device to ensure compliance.

3. **Verify Device Compliance with Intune:**
   - Open the **Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center**.
   - Check if the device is enrolled in Intune and verify its compliance status.

4. **Re-enable the Device:**
   - If the device is disabled, re-enable it by following these steps:
     - In Azure AD under the **Devices** section, select the device and click **Enable**.

5. **User Account Review:**
   - Check the user's status in Azure AD to ensure the account is active.
   - Verify password status and that the account is not locked.

6. **Re-attempt Authentication:**
   - After making the necessary adjustments, have the user attempt to authenticate again.

7. **Monitor Logs for Further Issues:**
   - If the issue persists, continue to monitor Azure AD logs for additional error messages.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Ensure users are aware of their organization's device policies to prevent non-compliant devices from causing authentication failures.
- Make sure the device OS is updated, as outdated devices may be flagged as non-compliant.
- Check for network issues that may affect authentication if using VPNs or similar services.

### Advice for Data Collection

If you need to collect more information for troubleshooting:

- **Event Viewer Logs:**
  - Look for Event ID 4625 (Failed logon) in the Security logs on the device.
  
- **Network Tracing:**
  - Use tools like **NetTrace** or **Fiddler** to capture HTTP requests and responses during the authentication process, which may provide insight into any redirection issues or additional error messages.

- **Fiddler Setup:**
  - Install Fiddler and enable HTTPS decryption to capture detailed information about the requests being sent, including headers and payloads.

By following these steps and consulting the provided documentation, you should be able to resolve the AADSTS135011 error effectively.

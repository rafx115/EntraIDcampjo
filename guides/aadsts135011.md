## Troubleshooting Steps
**Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS135011: "Device used during the authentication is disabled"**

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:**
1. **Confirm the Error:** Make sure the error code AADSTS135011 is indeed related to the device being disabled during authentication.
2. **Check Device Status:** Verify if the device used for authentication is actually disabled within your organization's security policies or Azure Active Directory (AAD) settings.
3. **Review Recent Changes:** Determine if any recent changes like device disablement policies or updates could have caused this issue.

**Common Issues that Cause this Error:**
1. **Device Management Policies:** Security policies configured for managing devices within the organization might disable certain devices for authentication.
2. **Expired or Inactive Devices:** Devices that were inactive or not compliant with security standards might get disabled for authentication.
3. **Conditional Access Policies:** Conditional Access policies configured in AAD could be restricting the use of specific devices for authentication.

**Step-by-step Resolution Strategies:**
1. **Check Device Status:**
   - Go to Azure Active Directory portal.
   - Navigate to "Devices" or "Intune" depending on your device management setup.
   - Look for the specific device that encountered the issue.
   - Check if the device status is marked as disabled or not compliant.
   - If disabled, investigate the reason for the disablement.

2. **Review Device Policies:**
   - Review the device management policies and conditional access policies applied within your organization.
   - Check if any specific policy is affecting the device in question.
   - Adjust the policies as necessary to allow authentication from the device.

3. **Re-Enable the Device:**
   - If the device was disabled in error, re-enable it through the Azure portal.
   - Ensure the device is compliant with the organization's security policies before re-enabling.

4. **User Guidance:**
   - Instruct the user to re-authenticate from a different enabled device if necessary.
   - Educate users on compliance requirements for devices used for authentication.

**Additional Notes or Considerations:**
- **Log Analysis:** Check Azure AD logs for more detailed information on the error and device status changes.
- **Device Compliance:** Ensure all devices used for authentication meet the organization's compliance standards.
- **User Communication:** Communicate clearly with users about any changes in device policies or authentication requirements.

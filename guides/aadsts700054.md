# AADSTS700054: Response_type 'id_token' isn't enabled for the application. The application requested an ID token from the authorization endpoint, but did not have ID token implicit grant enabled. Sign in to theMicrosoft Entra admin centeras at least aCloud Application Administratorand then browse toIdentity>Applications>App registrations. Select your application and then selectAuthentication. UnderImplicit grant and hybrid flows, make sureID tokens'is selected.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! When dealing with the error code AADSTS700054, which states that the response type 'id_token' isn't enabled for the application, you will need to follow a structured troubleshooting guide. 

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS700054

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Verify the Application Registration**:
   - Log into the Microsoft Entra (formerly Azure Active Directory) admin center.
   - Navigate to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations**.
   - Look up the application that is returning the error.

2. **Check the Authentication Settings**:
   - Once you've located your application, select it.
   - Go to the **Authentication** section.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error
- The **ID token** setting under **Implicit grant and hybrid flows** is **not selected**.
- The application is attempting to use an **implicit flow** without proper configuration.
- Configurations might be correct, but there are multiple versions of the application registered causing confusion.
- The application may be trying to use an outdated **OAuth 2.0** endpoint or has incorrect redirect URI settings.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Enable ID Token**:
   - In the **Authentication** section of your application's settings, find the **Implicit grant and hybrid flows** section.
   - Ensure that the checkbox for **ID tokens** is **checked**. If itâ€™s not, check it, and save the changes.

2. **Review Redirect URIs**:
   - Make sure that the redirection URIs are correctly configured to receive the token.
   - Check that the URI is correctly entered and matches the format expected by the application.

3. **Permissions and Roles**:
   - Confirm the account you are using has sufficient permissions within the Azure portal. At a minimum, you should be a **Cloud Application Administrator**.

4. **Testing**:
    - After configuring the settings, try to sign in again to see if the error persists.
    - If it still occurs, clear caches or test from an incognito/private browser session, or check from a different environment.

5. **Review Application Logs**:
   - Review any application logs to see additional details about the failure.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- If the application is being developed or improved, you might want to explore switching to the **Authorization Code Flow** with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) as it is more secure than the implicit grant flow.
- Always ensure that your application follows the best practices for OAuth 2.0.

#### Documentation for Guidance
- Microsoft Documentation for Azure AD:
  - [Quickstart: Set up the application to call a web API using the implicit grant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow)
  - [Configure a web application to sign-in and access a web API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-web-app-sign-in)
  - [Overview of OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-overview)

#### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Collect logs from the Event Viewer under the **Application** and **Security** sections, which may provide insights into failed authentication events.

- **Network Trace**:
   - Utilize tools like **Fiddler** or **Postman** to capture and inspect the network calls made during the authentication attempt to identify where it might be failing.

- **NetTrace**:
   - For .NET applications, collecting traces using logging tools or enabling detailed trace might reveal significant information about the failure.

Following this structured guide should assist in diagnosing and resolving the AADSTS700054 error in your application. If the issue persists after these steps, consider reaching out to Microsoft support for further assistance.

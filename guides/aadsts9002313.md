# AADSTS9002313: InvalidRequest - Request is malformed or invalid. - The issue arises because there was something wrong with the request to a certain endpoint. The suggestion to this issue is to get a fiddler trace of the error occurring and looking to see if the request is properly formatted or not.


## Troubleshooting Steps
## Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS9002313: InvalidRequest

### Overview
The error code `AADSTS9002313` indicates that there was an issue with the request sent to an Azure Active Directory (AAD) endpoint. This usually means that either the request was malformed or didn't conform to the expected structure for the specific API being called. 

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify the Endpoint**: Determine which API or authentication endpoint was called when you encountered the error.
2. **Check the Error Message**: Read through the complete error message for additional context that could provide clues about what specifically went wrong.
3. **Reproduce the Error**: Try to reproduce the error to confirm if it’s consistent and to gather more details about the conditions under which it occurs.
   
### Common Issues that Cause this Error
1. **Malformed Request**: The structure of the request (JSON format, headers, body) is incorrect.
2. **Missing Required Parameters**: Essential parameters (like client ID, secret) might be missing from the request.
3. **Incorrect HTTP Method**: Using the wrong HTTP method (POST, GET, etc.) to make the request.
4. **Mismatch between Application Registration and Request**: The details in the request don't match what's registered in Azure AD (e.g., Redirect URI, permissions).
5. **Token Expiration**: An expired access token being passed along with the request.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Capture the Request**:
   - Use Fiddler or a similar tool to capture the raw HTTP/HTTPS request being sent to the Azure endpoint.
   - Review the captured request to verify its structure.
   
2. **Validate the Request Format**:
   - Check the HTTP method being used (GET, POST, etc.).
   - Confirm that the URL endpoint is correct.
   - Ensure that all required headers (like `Content-Type`, `Authorization`) are present and formatted correctly.
   - Check the request body, ensuring that it’s valid JSON if that’s required.

3. **Check Required Parameters**:
   - Ensure that all mandatory parameters are included and correctly populated (e.g., `client_id`, `client_secret`, `scope`, etc.).
  
4. **Match Application Registration**:
   - Go to Azure Portal and verify the application registration details.
   - Ensure that `Redirect URI` and other settings match what’s in your request.

5. **Check for Expired Tokens**:
   - If a token is involved, verify it hasn’t expired. If it has, request a new token.

6. **Consult Documentation**:
   - Look at the Azure Active Directory documentation for the specific endpoint you are trying to reach to ensure you are following the expected request format:
     - [Azure AD REST API documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-overview)
  
7. **Retry the Request**: After making adjustments based on the previous checks, try to send the request again.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Network Configuration**: Ensure there are no network issues preventing the request from reaching Azure AD.
- **Local Environment Issues**: Sometimes local firewalls or proxy settings can interfere with outbound HTTP requests; check these settings if applicable.

### Data Collection for Analysis
1. **Event Viewer Logs**: Check the Application logs in Event Viewer for any relevant error logs related to your application.
2. **Network Traces**: Use tools like NetCapture or Wireshark if needed to capture traffic and analyze it for any connectivity issues.
3. **Fiddler Logs**: Save the Fiddler session and look carefully at the request details for missing or malformed elements.

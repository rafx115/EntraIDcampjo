# AADSTS9002313: InvalidRequest - Request is malformed or invalid. - The issue arises because there was something wrong with the request to a certain endpoint. The suggestion to this issue is to get a fiddler trace of the error occurring and looking to see if the request is properly formatted or not.


## Troubleshooting Steps
## Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS9002313: InvalidRequest - Malformed or Invalid Request

### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps

Before diving deeper into troubleshooting, start with these initial steps:

- **Note the Context**: Identify when and where the error occurs (specific application, endpoint, etc.).
- **Review Application Logs**: Check for any logs that might provide additional context on the request being made.
- **Identify the Endpoint**: Determine the specific Azure Active Directory (AAD) endpoint your application is using when the error occurs.

### 2. Common Issues That Cause This Error

This error can arise due to several common issues:

- **Malformed Requests**: The request might be improperly formatted, leading to parsing errors.
- **Missing Required Parameters**: Essential parameters like client ID, redirect URI, scope, etc., may be missing.
- **Invalid Parameter Values**: Parameters may contain invalid or unsupported values (e.g., a malformed redirect URI).
- **Incompatibility with the Endpoint**: Using an incorrect endpoint for the authentication flow (e.g., EU endpoint vs. global endpoint).
- **Token Issue**: Sometimes the problem arises from an invalid token or missing token in the request.
- **Improper Headers**: Missing or incorrect HTTP headers (like Content-Type).

### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

#### Step 1: Use Fiddler to Capture the Request

1. **Download and Install Fiddler**: If you haven't already, download and install Fiddler (https://www.telerik.com/fiddler).
2. **Capture the Request**: Start Fiddler and reproduce the error while capturing the traffic.
3. **Inspect the Request**: Look through the captured data to find the specific request that resulted in the AADSTS9002313 error.

#### Step 2: Analyze the Malformed Request

1. **Check Request URI**: Ensure that the endpoint URI is formatted correctly and matches the expected public AAD endpoints.
2. **Check Query Parameters**: Look for common required parameters (client_id, redirect_uri, scope, response_type).
3. **Validate Values**: Ensure that no values contain malformed characters (e.g., spaces, incorrect encoding).
4. **Check Headers**: Ensure that required headers (such as Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded) are present.

#### Step 3: Adjust and Re-test

1. **Modify the Request**: Based on your analysis, modify the request to ensure it meets the required format and contains all necessary values.
2. **Re-test the Request**: After making adjustments, send the request again and check if the error persists.
3. **Document Changes**: Keep a log of changes made for future reference and troubleshooting.

### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Use AAD Protocols**: Always refer to Azure Active Directory's OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect documentation for proper request formats and parameters.
- **Version Updates**: Ensure your application library or SDK is up-to-date, as APIs often get version updates and deprecations.
- **Network Issues**: Sometimes, firewall configurations or proxy settings can interfere with API calls.
- **Reach Azure Support**: If the issue persists after checking the request, consider reaching out to Microsoft Azure support.

### 5. Documentation

- **Azure Active Directory OAuth 2.0 Documentation**: [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow)
- **Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)**: [MSAL Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview)
- **Fiddler Documentation**: [Fiddler Getting Started](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/overview/getting-started)

### 6. Test Documentation Reachability

Verify that the documentation links above can be accessed and that they contain relevant information regarding your troubleshooting.

### 7. Advice for Data Collection

- **Log Details**: Gather relevant logs and error messages. Record specific configurations and settings within your application.
- **Include Request and Response**: If possible, collect the original malformed request and accompanying response data.
- **Maintain Environment Consistency**: Ensure a consistent testing environment where changes can be controlled and monitored.
- **Create a Test Case**: If you suspect consistent issues, create an automated test case that can reproduce the problem for easier iteration through potential fixes.

By systematically following this guide, you should be able to identify the cause of the AADSTS9002313 error and implement the necessary changes to solve it.

# AADSTS1000000: UserNotBoundError - The Bind API requires the Microsoft Entra user to also authenticate with an external IDP, which hasn't happened yet.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS1000000

Error code AADSTS1000000 indicates that the user must authenticate with an external identity provider (IDP) to successfully complete the bind process in Microsoft Entra (formerly Azure Active Directory). Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide to help diagnose and resolve this error.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Understand the Context**:
   - Identify the operation being performed when the error occurred. 
   - Determine if the user is attempting to access a resource, application, or service that requires multi-identity provider authentication.

2. **Check User Registration**:
   - Verify if the user account is fully registered with both Microsoft Entra and the external IDP.
   - Ensure that any necessary external account linking has occurred (e.g., a Google or Facebook account).

3. **Review Logs**:
   - Look for any additional error messages or warnings in the logs that could provide more context.

4. **Check Network Connectivity**:
   - Ensure that there are no network issues preventing the authentication request from reaching the external IDP.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **User Account Misconfiguration**:
   - The user may not be configured to access the external IDP, meaning the binding process cannot complete.

2. **External IDP Unavailability**:
   - The external IDP may be down or experiencing issues, preventing the user from authenticating.

3. **Identity Provider Settings**:
   - Misconfigured settings in the identity provider's application registration, such as redirect URIs or client secrets.

4. **Permissions and Policies**:
   - Improper permissions or policies preventing the user from being authenticated by the external IDP.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify User Account Information**:
   - Log into the Microsoft Entra admin center and check the user's details.
   - Ensure that they have valid credentials associated with the external IDP.

2. **Check External IDP Configuration**:
   - Access the external IDP's management console and verify that the user account associated with the external IDP is active and correctly configured.
   - For instance, if using a social IDP, confirm that the user's account is linked correctly.

3. **Test External IDP Authentication**:
   - Manually test the authentication process with the external IDP to ensure that it works correctly.
   - Ensure that there's no user lockout or security measures (like phone verification) hindering access.

4. **Review Application Permissions**:
   - Ensure that the application requiring the bind has the correct permissions to authenticate through the external IDP.
   - Adjust any policies that might block authentication.

5. **Reconfigure Identity Provider Settings**:
   - If necessary, reconfigure the identity provider settings in Microsoft Entra, ensuring that the configuration aligns with the external IDP's requirements.

6. **Consult Documentation**:
   - Check the official Microsoft and external IDP documentation for specific integration instructions and troubleshooting steps.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Audit Logs**: Evaluate Microsoft Entra's audit logs and the external IDP audit logs for any anomalies or issues associated with the userâ€™s authentication attempts.
- **Time Synchronization**: Check if the system time on your servers or client machines is synchronized. Any significant time difference could cause authentication issues.
- **Service Health**: Look into the service health dashboards of both Microsoft Entra and the external IDP for any reported outages or incidents.

#### Advice for Data Collection

In the event of troubleshooting, collecting data to diagnose the issue further may be helpful. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - On Windows machines, check the Event Viewer (Windows Logs > Application and Security) for authentication-related events.

2. **Network Traces**:
   - Use tools like **NetTracers** to capture network traffic and check for any failed requests towards the IDP.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Use Fiddler to capture HTTP/HTTPS traffic to observe the requests and responses during the authentication process to the external IDP.
   - Analyze the HTTP status codes and responses for any clues about what may be failing.

By following this structured troubleshooting approach, you should be able to identify and resolve the AADSTS1000000 error efficiently.

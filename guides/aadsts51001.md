### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Confirm Context**: Identify when and where the error occurs:
   - Is it during a user login attempt?
   - Is it involving an application using Azure AD authentication?

2. **Identify the User**: Determine if the error occurs for specific users, multiple users, or all users.

3. **Check User Credentials**: Confirm that the user is using the correct credentials.

4. **Review Domain Configuration**: Ensure that the user belongs to a recognized domain that is configured in Azure AD.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Domain Hint Not Provided**: The error happens when the authentication request does not include a domain hint for on-premises users.
   
2. **User Principal Name (UPN) Mismatch**: The UPN for the user may not match the on-premises directory.

3. **Incorrect Security Identifier (SID)**: The provided SID does not correspond to a valid on-premises user.

4. **Misconfigured Applications**: Applications that interface with Azure AD may not be set up correctly to send the domain hint.

5. **Network Issues**: There may be connectivity problems preventing communication with Azure AD.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Add Domain Hint in Authentication Request**:
   - Modify the authentication request to include a domain hint for the domain used by the on-premises user. The domain hint format should be `domain.com`.
   - Example: `prompt=login&domain_hint=domain.com`.

2. **Verify UPN**:
   - Check that the UPN used by the user corresponds to an entry in Azure AD.
   - Ensure it follows the format: `username@domain.com`.

3. **Check User Attributes**:
   - Verify that the user account has the correct attributes set in Azure AD.
   - Use Azure AD PowerShell or the Azure portal to check user properties.

4. **Monitor Synchronization**:
   - If using Azure AD Connect, ensure that it is functioning correctly and synchronizing on-premises identities to Azure AD.
   - Check for any synchronization errors.

5. **Update Application Code**:
   - If the error arises from a custom application, ensure that the authentication code includes the necessary domain hint.

6. **Test with Different User Accounts**:
   - Attempt to replicate the issue with different user accounts, especially those known to work correctly.

7. **Review Azure AD Sign-ins Logs**:
   - Access the Azure portal and review the sign-in logs for detailed error messages and timestamps to narrow down issues.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Application Registration**: Ensure that your application is registered correctly in Azure AD with the right permissions and redirect URIs.

- **Token Configuration**: Review token configuration settings in Azure AD for any misconfigurations that might affect sign-in.

- **User Licensing**: Check if the users encountering issues have the necessary licenses assigned in Azure AD.

### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Look for application and system logs related to authentication or Azure AD as these can reveal additional details related to the issue.

2. **NetTrace**:
   - Run network traces to analyze authentication requests and responses to determine if they include domain hints and assess any failed requests.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Use Fiddler to capture HTTP/S traffic when the error occurs. Look for the authentication requests and responses to verify that the domains and URIs are correct.

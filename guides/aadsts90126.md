# AADSTS90126: DebugModeEnrollTenantNotInferred - The user type isn't supported on this endpoint. The system can't infer the user's tenant from the user name.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The error code AADSTS90126 indicates a tenant inference issue when a user attempts to authenticate or access a particular endpoint in Azure Active Directory (AAD). This error arises primarily when the Azure AD system cannot determine which tenant the user belongs to through their username. Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS90126

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Review the Error Message**: Gather the complete error message that accompanies the AADSTS90126 code. This can provide context as to what specific conditions led to the issue.

2. **Check User Information**: Confirm the user's email or username format is correct, and the domain is registered in Azure AD.

3. **Tenant Status**: Ensure that the tenant the user is trying to access is active and not in a disabled or deleted state.

4. **User Type**: Determine whether the user is a guest or member in the tenant. Only members typically have access to certain endpoints.

5. **Endpoint Validity**: Verify that the endpoint being accessed is indeed configured to accept the type of user (e.g., member vs. guest).

#### Common Issues That Cause AADSTS90126 Error
- **Unsupported User Type**: The user might be trying to authenticate using an account type that is not supported at the endpoint.
- **Invalid or Unrecognized Domain**: The domain in the username might not be recognized by Azure AD.
- **Guest User Access Issues**: If the user is joining as a guest, their access permissions might not allow them to access the specified resource.
- **Propagation Delay**: Newly added users might take some time to propagate across all services in Azure.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Confirm Userâ€™s Domain**
   - Log into Azure AD.
   - Go to `Users` > `All users`.
   - Search for the user and verify that their account exists with the correct domain.

2. **Check User Type**
   - Verify the user type from the `Users` section; make sure they are a **Member** rather than a **Guest** if necessary.

3. **Validate User Email Format**
   - Ensure the user is using the correct email format (e.g., user@domain.com).
   - If applicable, check that the user is using the appropriate authenticator method for their user type.

4. **Specify Tenant Identifier**
   - If applicable, the user should explicitly specify their tenant using `user@tenant.onmicrosoft.com` or a specific domain associated with the tenant.

5. **Review Endpoint Settings**
   - Ensure that the application or service endpoint being targeted accepts the user type being used.
   - Check the configuration policies and privileges assigned to that endpoint.

6. **Invite as Guest (if applicable)**
   - For guest users that need access, ensure they are invited correctly. The invitation email should be sent from Azure AD.

7. **Check Tenant Configurations**
   - Review the configurations for user assignments and roles within Azure AD to ensure the user is assigned the right roles.

8. **Reattempt Authentication**
   - After making necessary changes, guide the user to retry the authentication process.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure the user logs out of any existing sessions before attempting to log in again.
- Be aware of multi-tenant applications; sometimes the app requires specific setup for each tenant.

#### Documentation
- For detailed guidance, refer to the official Microsoft documentation:
  - [Azure AD Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/)
  - [Understanding Azure AD Error Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aad-errors)
  
    **Note**: Ensure that this documentation is reachable from your environment by checking the links.

#### Advice for Data Collection
- When troubleshooting, collect the following data:
  1. Full error message with AADSTS90126.
  2. User information (username, tenant).
  3. Specific endpoint URL where the error occurred.
  4. User type on the tenant (member or guest).
  5. Any recent changes to user permissions or roles within the Azure portal.

By systematically following these steps and collecting relevant data, you can effectively diagnose and resolve the issue related to the AADSTS90126 error.

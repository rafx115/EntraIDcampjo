### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **Incorrect Formatting**: Users may enter email addresses in incorrect formats (e.g., missing "@" symbol, missing domain, additional spaces).

2. **Trailing Spaces or Non-visible Characters**: Users may paste email addresses that contain leading or trailing spaces or special characters that aren't visible.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Implement client-side validation to ensure the email address is in the correct format before submission. Regular Expressions (RegEx) can be effective for this.
   - Example regex pattern for validation: 
     ```regex
     ^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$
     ```

2. **User Education**:
   - Provide user-friendly error messages indicating what a valid email format should look like.
   - Display examples of valid email addresses beside the input field.

3. **Sanitization of Input**:
   - Strip leading/trailing whitespace from the email address upon input submission.
   - Check for any non-visible characters and remove them if detected.

4. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Create a list of valid and invalid email addresses and conduct multiple test cases using both.
   - Use logging to track input values and prepare reports of invalid entries to inform further improvements in validation.

5. **Consult Documentation**:
   - If the error is rooted in configuration with Azure Active Directory, consult the official Microsoft Azure AD documentation regarding user authentication and input requirements.
   - You can visit [Azure AD Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/) for guidance.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Localization**: If the application supports multiple languages, ensure that email validation messages are properly localized.
  
- **Response to Failure**: You may want to implement a mechanism to allow users to recover gracefully after an error. For example, retaining the email they attempted to enter to ease frustration.

## Troubleshooting Steps
Here's a detailed troubleshooting guide for the error code **AADSTS90008** with the description **"TokenForItselfRequiresGraphPermission - The user or administrator hasn't consented to use the application. At the minimum, the application requires access to Microsoft Entra ID by specifying the sign-in and read user profile permission."**

### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps
- **Check the Application Registration**: Determine if the application is properly registered in the Azure portal. Go to Azure Active Directory > App registrations and locate the application.
- **Review Permissions**: Check the API permissions assigned to the application. Ensure that it has access to Microsoft Graph and that the 'Sign in and read user profile' permissions are included.
- **User Consent Status**: Check if the user or administrator has provided consent for the required permissions. In some cases, permissions may need admin consent, especially for applications that require broad access.
- **User Authentication Status**: Confirm that the user experiencing the issue is authenticated and has valid access to the application.

### 2. Common Issues that Cause This Error
- **Missing Permissions**: The application does not have the required permissions configured in Azure AD.
- **Lack of Consent**: The user has not consented, or the required admin consent has not been provided.
- **Incorrect Scope**: The token request may involve scopes that are not consented to, leading to permission issues.
- **User Role Limitations**: The user may not have sufficient roles or permissions to access certain application features.

### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Log into the Azure Portal**: Access your Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to **Azure Active Directory**.

2. **Find the Application**:
   - Select **App registrations**.
   - Search and select the application that's causing the error.

3. **Review API Permissions**:
   - Click on **API permissions**.
   - Ensure the following permissions are added:
     - **Microsoft Graph > User.Read** (for sign-in and profile read).
   - If permissions are missing, click on **Add a permission**, select Microsoft Graph, and add the required permissions.

4. **Consent to Permissions**:
   - After ensuring all necessary permissions are in place, click on the **Grant admin consent for [Your Organization]** button if admin consent is needed.
   - You will receive confirmation that consent has been granted.

5. **Check User Roles (if applicable)**:
   - Ensure that the user has the appropriate roles assigned under **Users** > [Select User] > **Assigned roles**.

6. **Test Authentication**:
   - Have the user log out and then log back in to the application to check if the issue is resolved.

7. **Validate Token Scopes**:
   - If you're still facing the issue, check what scopes are being requested during the token acquisition and ensure they match those that have been consented.

### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Consent for Users vs. Admins**: Understand the differences in consent types; certain operations might require admin consent while others may not.
- **Token Expiration**: Sometimes, older tokens may still be cached. Ensure that the user obtains a fresh token after updating permissions.

### 5. Documentation Where Steps Can Be Found for Guidance
- [Microsoft Azure AD Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/)
- [How to Register an Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)
- [How to Configure Permissions for Azure AD Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent)

### 6. Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer Logs, NetTrace, Fiddler)
- **Event Viewer Logs**: Check for any application-specific logs on the client machine that may provide additional context to user sign-in errors.
- **Fiddler or Similar Network Tools**: Use Fiddler to inspect the authentication requests being sent to Azure AD. This can help verify if the correct scopes are being requested and if responses contain any additional error details.
- **Network Trace**: Analyze network traffic to look for failed or malformed requests/responses between the client application and Azure AD.

Collecting this information will help diagnose any underlying issues leading to the error and provide a clearer resolution path.

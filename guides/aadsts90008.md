## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide: Error Code AADSTS90008

#### Error Description:
TokenForItselfRequiresGraphPermission - The user or administrator hasn't consented to use the application. At the minimum, the application requires access to Microsoft Entra ID by specifying the sign-in and read user profile permission.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Confirm Permission Requirements:** Validate that the application indeed requires access to Microsoft Graph to function properly, as specified by the error message.
2. **Check Application Configuration:** Ensure that the required permissions for the application are correctly set up in Azure AD.
3. **User Consent Status:** Verify if users have been prompted to consent to these permissions during the authentication process.
4. **Check Admin Consent:** Ensure that the necessary permissions have been granted by the admin.

#### Common Issues:
- **Missing Required Permissions:** The application may not have the required permissions configured in Azure AD.
- **Admin Consent Not Given:** If admin consent is required, it may not have been granted.
- **User Consent Not Given:** Users might not have been prompted to consent to the required permissions.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Add Required Permissions:**
   - Go to the Azure portal and navigate to the Azure AD application registration for your app.
   - Add the necessary permissions, such as 'Sign in and read user profile' for Microsoft Graph.
   
2. **User Consent:**
   - Have the user attempt to sign in again to trigger the consent prompt.
   - The user will need to consent to the required permissions during the sign-in process.

3. **Admin Consent:**
   - If admin consent is required, the administrator should grant consent.
   - Admin consent can be given through the Azure portal or by using the admin consent endpoint.

4. **Check Authentication Flow:**
   - Ensure that the authentication flow in your application correctly handles consent requests.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- **Consider Conditional Access Policies:** If Conditional Access policies are in place, they could be blocking the required permissions. Review any policies that might impact application access.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Monitor Azure AD logs to track consent requests and failures for troubleshooting.
- **Application Lifecyle Management:** Properly manage application updates and configuration changes in Azure AD.

# AADSTS81006: DesktopSsoNoAuthorizationHeader - No authorization header was found.


## Troubleshooting Steps
**Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS81006: DesktopSsoNoAuthorizationHeader - No authorization header was found.**

<<<<<<< HEAD
This error typically occurs in Azure Active Directory (AAD) scenarios when a client application attempts to access a resource without providing a valid authorization header. This guide will provide you with detailed steps to diagnose and resolve this issue.
=======
#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Verify Error Context**: Understand where and when the error occurs � during sign-in, authentication, token validation, etc.
2. **Check Logs**: Review logs or error messages to gather more information about the specific environment and context of the error.
3. **Confirm Environment Setup**: Check if the correct configurations are in place for the authentication process.

### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check the Error Context**: Determine when and where the error occurs. Is it during login, when accessing a specific resource, or after authentication?
2. **Review Application Configuration**: Verify the application registration in Azure AD. This includes checking redirect URIs, permissions, and secret/key configurations.
3. **Check Network Trace**: Use a network tracing tool (like Fiddler or browser developer tools) to capture the network request. Look for the authorization header and examine its contents.
4. **Review Client Logs**: If available, analyze the client application logs. They may provide more context about why the authorization header is missing.

### 2. Common Issues that Cause This Error

- **Missing Authorization Header**: The application may not be adding the `Authorization` header to the requests.
- **Corrupted Authentication Token**: The access token could be corrupted or expired, and the application doesn’t provide a valid one.
- **Incorrect Scopes and Permissions**: The application may not be requesting the necessary scopes or might lack the appropriate API permissions in Azure AD.
- **Misconfiguration of the Application**: Settings such as client ID, tenant ID, or redirect URIs might not be correctly set in the Azure portal.

### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

#### Step 1: Verify Authorization Flow

- Ensure that the application's authentication flow is implemented correctly (e.g., authorization code flow, implicit flow).
- For desktop applications, ensure you’re using the appropriate MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library) version and configuring it for single sign-on (SSO) correctly.

#### Step 2: Update Client Application Code

- **Add Authorization Header**: Modify the client application to include the correct `Authorization` header in its HTTP requests:
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
  ```
  
- **Handle Token Acquisition**: Implement a token acquisition mechanism that checks if the access token is present and valid:
  ```csharp
  if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(accessToken)) {
      // Acquire a new token
  }
  ```

#### Step 3: Validate the Token

- Use tools like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) to decode and verify the access token. Check the following:
  - **Expiration:** Ensure the token is not expired.
  - **Scopes:** Verify that the token contains the correct scopes for accessing the intended resource.
  
#### Step 4: Check API Permissions

- In Azure AD, navigate to your app registration and ensure that:
  - The necessary API permissions are granted.
  - Consent has been provided for the permissions if required.

#### Step 5: Review Application Registration

- Go to **Azure Active Directory > App registrations > Your App**. Check the following sections:
  - **Redirect URIs**: Check that all URIs used by the application are listed here.
  - **Authentication**: Ensure that you have enabled the correct flows (like implicit or code flow).
  - **Secrets Certificates**: Confirm that secret/key is valid and not expired.

### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations

- Ensure that there are no proxy settings that may strip out headers in corporate environments.
- Check if any recent updates or changes have been made to Azure AD or the application that could have affected the authentication process.

### 5. Documentation and Resources

- Microsoft’s official documentation for [Azure AD authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios) provides detailed information about authentication flows and configurations.
- If you're using MSAL, check [documentation for MSAL libraries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview).

### 6. Test the Documentation Reachability

- Ensure the documentation links provided above are accessible by attempting to access them through a web browser.

### 7. Advice for Data Collection

- Collect relevant logs from the client application, including timestamped error messages and stack traces.
- Capture network traces to analyze the request and response headers, particularly focusing on the absence of the Authorization header.
- Document all configuration settings from Azure AD related to the application registration.

By following these steps systematically, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue causing the `AADSTS81006` error with the DesktopSsoNoAuthorizationHeader message. If the problem persists, consider reaching out to Microsoft Support for further assistance.

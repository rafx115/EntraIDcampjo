# AADSTS50180: WindowsIntegratedAuthMissing - Integrated Windows authentication is needed. Enable the tenant for Seamless SSO.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The AADSTS50180 error indicates that Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) is required but not configured correctly. Here’s a detailed troubleshooting guide to help you resolve this issue.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50180

#### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps
- **Verify User’s Environment**: Confirm that the user experiencing the error is using a Windows environment and has access to the necessary resources.
- **Check Application Type**: Determine if the application is a web app, desktop app, or mobile app. This can affect authentication methods.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure the user is using a compatible browser for Integrated Windows Authentication (e.g., Internet Explorer or Edge).
- **Validate Tenant Configuration**: Check if the Azure AD tenant has Seamless Single Sign-On (SSO) enabled.

#### 2. Common Issues That Cause This Error
- **Seamless SSO Not Enabled**: The tenant may not have Seamless SSO enabled.
- **Incorrect URL Configuration**: The URL being accessed may not be in the local intranet zone of Internet Explorer.
- **Authentication Policy Restrictions**: There may be policies in place that prevent IWA from functioning.
- **Network Issues**: Network configurations or firewalls may be restricting access to the necessary authentication endpoints.
- **Group Policy Settings**: Local or domain group policies may override desired settings.

#### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
- **Enable Seamless SSO**:
  1. Log in to the Azure portal.
  2. Navigate to “Azure Active Directory” > “Enterprise applications”.
  3. Search for your application and select it.
  4. Go to the “Single sign-on” section.
  5. Enable the Seamless SSO option.
  
- **Configure the Browser for IWA**:
  1. Open Internet Explorer or Edge.
  2. Go to “Internet Options” > “Security”.
  3. Select the “Local intranet” zone and click “Sites”.
  4. Add your application’s URL to the zone if not already included.
  5. Ensure that “Automatic logon with current user name and password” is selected under the “Custom level” settings.

- **Check Network Configurations**:
  1. Ensure that your network allows traffic to the Azure AD endpoints.
  2. Check for any proxies or firewalls that may affect the authenticating traffic.

- **Review Group Policies**:
  1. Use the Group Policy Management Console to check for any GPOs that may be affecting IWA.
  2. Look specifically for policies related to “Authentication Policies” or “Web Browser Settings”.

#### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations
- **User Permissions**: Ensure the user attempting to authenticate has the correct permissions assigned in the Azure AD.
- **App Registration**: Check if the application is correctly registered in Azure AD and configured to receive tokens.
- **Time Synchronization**: Ensure that the system time on the user’s machine is synchronized with a time server.

#### 6. Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**: 
  - Open Event Viewer on the user's machine.
  - Navigate to “Windows Logs” > “Application”.
  - Search for events related to authentication failures or Azure AD issues.

- **Network Tracer (Nettrace) and Fiddler**:
  - Use NetTrace to capture traffic while reproducing the issue. Look for HTTP 401 responses or any errors related to authentication.
  - Use Fiddler to inspect the web requests/responses and look for problems in the authentication headers.

- **Logs**: 
  - Collect logs from your application if it has logging enabled (e.g., application logs, security logs) for further insights.

# AADSTS75003: UnsupportedBindingError - The app returned an error related to unsupported binding (SAML protocol response can't be sent via bindings other than HTTP POST).


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS75003 Error Code (UnsupportedBindingError)

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Identify the SAML Service Provider (SP):** Determine which application or service is acting as the SAML Service Provider.
2. **Review SAML Requests and Responses:** Check the SAML requests and responses exchanged between the Identity Provider (IdP) and the application for inconsistencies or unsupported binding issues.
3. **Check Configuration Settings:** Verify the configuration settings in both the IdP and the SP for any misconfigurations related to SAML bindings.

#### Common Issues that Cause this Error:
1. **Incorrect or Unsupported SAML Binding:** The SAML protocol response is being sent using a binding other than HTTP POST, which is not supported by the application.
2. **Misconfigured SAML Properties:** Incorrect configurations related to SAML bindings in the application's settings can lead to unsupported binding errors.
3. **IdP and SP Mismatch:** Inconsistent SAML binding configurations between the IdP and SP can cause compatibility issues.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Check SAML Assertion Binding Configuration:**
   - Verify that the SAML responses are configured to use the correct binding (HTTP POST) in both the IdP and SP settings.

2. **Update Application Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the application's SAML configuration is aligned with the requirements of the SP to use only HTTP POST binding for SAML responses.

3. **Review IdP Settings:**
   - Check the Identity Provider's settings to confirm that the responses are generated with the appropriate SAML bindings.

4. **Test SAML Authentication Flow:**
   - Validate the SAML authentication flow by initiating a test login to identify if the error persists.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- Ensure that the SAML metadata in both the IdP and SP configurations is up-to-date with the correct bindings specified.
- Consult the application's documentation or contact the application's support team for specific guidance on configuring SAML bindings.
- Regularly monitor for any updates or changes in the SAML configurations to prevent future binding-related errors.

#### Documentation for Guidance:
- [Azure Active Directory SAML-based single sign-on documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/single-sign-on-saml-protocol#error-75001-75002-75003) contains detailed information on common SAML errors, including error code AADSTS75003, with troubleshooting steps and best practices.

By following these troubleshooting steps and considerations, you should be able to address the UnsupportedBindingError (AADSTS75003) related to unsupported SAML bindings effectively.

# AADSTS75003: UnsupportedBindingError - The app returned an error related to unsupported binding (SAML protocol response can't be sent via bindings other than HTTP POST).


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS75003: UnsupportedBindingError

**Description:**
AADSTS75003 indicates that the application is returning an error related to unsupported SAML bindings. Specifically, it means that the SAML protocol response must use HTTP POST binding, as other bindings (like HTTP Redirect) may not be supported correctly.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Verify the SAML Configuration:**
   - Check the SAML settings in both the identity provider (IdP) and the service provider (SP) configurations to ensure they are set up to communicate via HTTP POST.

2. **Review the Error Message:**
   - Look for additional details in the error message that may indicate which binding is being attempted (e.g., HTTP Redirect vs. HTTP POST).

3. **Perform a Test Login:**
   - Attempt to authenticate again and capture the SAML request and response using developer tools in your browser or by checking the server logs.

### Common Issues that Cause this Error

1. **Misconfigured SAML Endpoints:**
   - The application's SAML settings may be sending a response via HTTP Redirect, while the IdP is expecting HTTP POST.

2. **Examining the SAML Metadata:**
   - The SAML metadata may not define the correct binding types for response handling, leading to a mismatch.

3. **Identity Provider Settings:**
   - The identity provider settings may not correctly specify that HTTP POST should be used for SAML responses.

4. **Application Behavior:**
   - The application may have a bug or misconfiguration that tries to redirect the SAML response incorrectly.

### Step-By-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Check SAML Endpoint URLs:**
   - Verify the assertion consumer service (ACS) URL in your application’s configuration:
     - Ensure it is entered correctly and points to the right URL provided by the identity provider.

2. **Modify the Binding Type:**
   - If applicable, change the response binding to HTTP POST in the Azure AD configuration (or your IdP configuration). 

   For Azure AD:
   - Navigate to Azure portal → Azure Active Directory → Enterprise Applications → Your Application → Single sign-on settings → Ensure the SAML response binding is set to POST.

3. **Inspect SAML Metadata:**
   - Check the metadata XML file for the application:
     - Ensure that the `<AssertionConsumerService>` element correctly specifies `Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST"`.

4. **Update Identity Provider Settings:**
   - Ensure that the identity provider is configured to use HTTP POST for responses. 

5. **Test Authentication:**
   - After making the changes, test the authentication process again and monitor the response.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Confirm that any intermediate proxies or firewalls are not obstructing or modifying the HTTP requests and responses, as this can sometimes lead to protocol mismatches.
- If you continue to face issues, increase logging verbosity on both the IdP and the SP to get more detailed insight into the error.

### Documentation and Guidance

### Advice for Data Collection

- **Capture SAML Requests/Responses:** Use tools like Fiddler or browser developer tools to capture and analyze the SAML requests and responses during the login process.
- **Logs from IdP and SP:** Review the application logs on both ends (IdP and SP) for any errors or details that can point toward the misconfiguration.
- **Request and Response Details:** Pay attention to the `Binding` attribute in both requests and responses.

By following this troubleshooting guide, you should be able to identify and resolve any issues related to AADSTS75003 with a focus on unsupported bindings in SAML responses.

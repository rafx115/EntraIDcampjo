# AADSTS75003: UnsupportedBindingError - The app returned an error related to unsupported binding (SAML protocol response can't be sent via bindings other than HTTP POST).


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS75003 Error

**Error Description:**
The error code AADSTS75003 indicates that there is an unsupported binding issue with a SAML protocol response. Specifically, it occurs when a SAML response is sent via a binding method other than HTTP POST, which is not supported by Azure Active Directory.

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify the Application:**
   - Determine which application is generating the error. This is critical for investigating the configuration.

2. **Review the Error Message:**
   - Look at any additional context that came with the error message. This might provide insights into which binding was attempted.

3. **Check Service Logs:**
   - Review the application or service logs for any related error messages that can give more context about the issue.

### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **Incorrect SAML Settings:**
   - The application may be using a configuration that sends SAML responses via an unsupported binding.

2. **Misconfiguration of Binding Type:**
   - The application might be configured to use HTTP-Redirect binding instead of HTTP-POST.

3. **Issues with Identity Provider:**
   - The identity provider (IdP) may not be configured correctly to handle SAML requests and responses.

4. **Custom Applications:**
   - Custom-built applications might not handle SAML responses correctly, especially if they are not following the SAML 2.0 specification strictly.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify SAML Configuration:**
   - Check the SAML configuration of your application:
     - Ensure that the **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL** is correctly configured.
     - Confirm that the binding type is set to **HTTP POST** for sending SAML responses.

2. **Inspect Metadata Configuration:**
   - If your application uses SAML metadata, review the metadata for correct configuration.
   - Confirm that the `Binding` attribute in the SAML metadata matches the requirements.

3. **Update Application Code:**
   - If the applicationâ€™s code explicitly handles SAML responses, ensure that it is configured to use HTTP POST for sending responses.

4. **Consult IdP Documentation:**
   - Review any documentation provided by the IdP for required configuration regarding binding types and other settings.

5. **Test the Application:**
   - After making any changes, conduct testing to ensure the application behaves as expected and does not generate the AADSTS75003 error anymore.

6. **Enable Logging in the Application:**
   - If issues persist, enable detailed logging in your application to capture the SAML requests and responses for further analysis.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Cross-Domain Issues:**
  - Be aware of cross-domain issues that may affect how your application interacts with the IdP.

- **Firewalls and Proxies:**
  - Ensure that there are no firewalls or proxies hindering the communication between your application and the IdP.

- **Updated Libraries:**
  - If your application uses SAML libraries, ensure that they are updated to the latest versions to avoid any known issues.

### Documentation & Resources

- **Microsoft Documentation:**
  - Azure Active Directory SAML-based SSO: [Microsoft Identity Platform SAML Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-saml-protocol)
  - SAML protocol specifications: [SAML 2.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-core-2.0-os.pdf)

- **Application-Specific Documentation:**
  - Refer to the official documentation for your specific application if it has detailed SAML configuration steps.

### Advice for Data Collection

If further data collection is needed, here are steps for gathering relevant logs:

1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - Review the Windows Event Viewer for any application or system logs that correlate with the time of the error.

2. **Network Tracing (NetTrace):**
   - Use tools like NetMon (NetTrace) to capture the network traffic during authentication attempts. Look for SAML traffic to analyze request and response bindings.

3. **Using Fiddler:**
   - Configure Fiddler to capture HTTP/S traffic, and analyze the SAML responses and requests. Look specifically for the binding types being used.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Ensure your application logs include sufficient detail to identify the SAML request and responses being generated.

By following this guide, you can systematically approach and troubleshoot the AADSTS75003 error while identifying any binding-related issues in your SAML configurations.

# AADSTS90027: We are unable to issue tokens from this API version on the MSA tenant. Please contact the application vendor as they need to use version 2.0 of the protocol to support this.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Here's a detailed troubleshooting guide for the error code AADSTS90027, along with diagnostic steps, common issues, resolution strategies, and documentation references.

### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS90027

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify the Application:** Determine which application or service is encountering this error. This is typically an application trying to access Microsoft services and is linked to your Azure Active Directory (AAD) configuration.

2. **Check User Tenant:** Ensure that the users trying to authenticate are part of a Microsoft Account (MSA) tenant rather than an Azure AD tenant. The error relates specifically to incompatibility with MSA.

3. **Reproduce the Issue:** Attempt to replicate the error to better understand under which conditions it occurs, such as specific users, applications, or environments.

4. **Review Application Logs:** If available, review the application logs where the error occurred. Note any additional error messages or stack traces that may aid diagnostics.

#### Common Issues that Cause this Error
1. **Incorrect API Version:** The application may be trying to use an unsupported version of the authentication API (often an older version) that is not compatible with the MSA tenant.

2. **MSA vs. Azure AD:** The application may not be correctly configured to handle the authentication for Microsoft Accounts versus Azure Active Directory accounts.

3. **Invalid Redirect URIs:** Incorrectly configured redirect URIs in the application registration might cause authentication failures.

4. **Permissions Issues:** The application may lack the necessary permissions to access the resources it is trying to.

5. **Incorrect Client Setup:** The application may have misconfigured client credentials or endpoint URLs.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Update Application to Use API Version 2.0:**
   - Ensure that the application is updated to use the version 2.0 of the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol.
   - Review the application's documentation or contact the vendor if you need specific versioning support.

2. **Reconfigure App Registration:**
   - Navigate to the Azure portal.
   - Go to "Azure Active Directory" > "App registrations".
   - Find your application and ensure that it is set up correctly to support the MSA tenant.

3. **Update Redirect URI:**
   - Check the redirect URIs in the Azure portal under the application's "Authentication" section.
   - Ensure they match the ones used in your application’s code.

4. **Validate Permissions:**
   - Review the API permissions for the application. Make sure that it has appropriate permissions granted and also check if any admin consent is required.

5. **Testing in Different Environments:**
   - Test the application in a development or test environment with a Microsoft Account to ensure compatibility.
   - Check if the problem is resolved when tested with an Azure AD account, indicating potentially incorrect setup for MSAs.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that users are authenticating with a valid Microsoft Account.
- If possible, check the application's documentation or contact their support to confirm compatibility with MSA.
- Review the type of accounts you are trying to use – MSA accounts vs. Azure AD accounts, as they behave differently.

#### Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer, Nettrace, Fiddler)
- **Event Viewer Logs:** Check for any related logs in the Event Viewer on the machine running the application. Look under Windows Logs > Application for any warnings/errors related to your application or relevant components.
- **Network Trace:** Tools like Wireshark can help capture network packets to analyze the request/response cycle.
- **Fiddler:** Use Fiddler to inspect the HTTP requests and responses. Look for the authentication requests to Azure AD and check the response for any clues about the issue.

# AADSTS90027: We are unable to issue tokens from this API version on the MSA tenant. Please contact the application vendor as they need to use version 2.0 of the protocol to support this.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS90027 Error Code

**Error Description**: 
The error code AADSTS90027 arises when an application attempts to issue tokens using an unsupported API version on a Microsoft Account (MSA) tenant. It indicates that the application must implement version 2.0 of the authentication protocol to successfully issue tokens.

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Read the Error Message**: Carefully check the error message for additional details about the request that caused the failure.
  
2. **Identify the API Version**: Determine the version of the API used in the application that is making the token request.

3. **Check App Registration**: Verify if the application is properly registered in Azure Active Directory (AAD) and confirm the permissions and scopes defined.

4. **Monitor Application Insights/Logs**: If your application utilizes Application Insights or any logging framework, check the logs for detailed error messages or failed authentication attempts.

5. **Reproduce the Error**: Attempt to replicate the error in a controlled environment to understand the specific conditions under which it occurs.

### Common Issues that Cause AADSTS90027

- **Using an Outdated API Version**: Applications still using version 1.0 of the protocol trying to authenticate against MSA tenants need to be updated to version 2.0.
  
- **Misconfigured App Registration**: The application may lack necessary permissions or scopes to allow certain operations.

- **Token Endpoint Misconfiguration**: The URL endpoints being called for token issuance may be incorrect or not matching those ordained for version 2.0.

- **API Implementation Errors**: The backend implementation may not support the features required by version 2.0.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Update API Version in Code**:
   - Check the authentication library or middleware used in your application.
   - Update the references to use Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) or the appropriate libraries that support version 2.0 of OAuth2.

2. **Adjust Registration Settings**:
   - Log into the Azure Portal and navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations**.
   - Select your application and verify the **Redirect URIs** and other settings, ensuring they align with the requirements of OAuth 2.0.
   
3. **Update Required Scopes/Permissions**:
   - Go to **API permissions** within your app registration and make sure that your application has admin-consented permissions for required APIs.
  
4. **Implement Authentication Flow**:
   - Utilize the authorization code flow or implicit flow as required for your application needs and ensure correct implementation.
   - Review Microsoftâ€™s documentation for implementation guidance:
     - [Microsoft identity platform documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview)

5. **Testing**: 
   - Utilize tools such as Postman to simulate authentication requests and confirm that tokens can be obtained correctly with the new configurations.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **MSAL vs. ADAL**: Ensure you are using the correct libraries for authentication. Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) supports version 2.0, whereas Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) is designed for version 1.0.
  
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in your application to gracefully catch and log errors when token issuance fails.

- **Tenant-Specific Issues**: Understand that some tokens may behave differently depending on whether you are working in a consumer (MSA) tenant or a commercial tenant.

### Advice for Data Collection

- **Error Logs**: Collect detailed logs from both client and server while replicating the issue.

- **HTTP Request/Response Transactions**: Capture the complete HTTP request details including headers, body, and server responses.

- **Token Details**: If tokens are generated, collect data such as claims, scopes, and expiration times for troubleshooting.

- **Environment Details**: Gather information about the environment (development, production) and authentication library versions in use.

This strategy should lead to identifying the cause of the AADSTS90027 error and resolving it by ensuring the application adheres to the correct API specifications.

### Common Issues that Cause this Error

1. **Disabled Service Principal:**
   - The service principal may have been manually disabled by an administrator.

2. **Expired or Lapsed Subscription:**
   - The Azure subscription associated with the application may have expired or lapsed, causing service principals to be disabled.

3. **Administrative Policies:**
   - Organizational policies might prevent certain applications from using Azure AD for authentication.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

#### Step 1: Check Service Principal Status

1. Navigate to the **Azure Portal**.

2. Review the status of the subscription linked to your application.
3. If the subscription has expired:
   - Renew the subscription as necessary.

#### Step 3: Modify Permissions/Policies

1. If the service principal is disabled due to policy:
   - Contact an Azure AD administrator to review application permissions.
   - Ask them if any administrative policies are blocking the application.

#### Step 4: Re-enable Service Principal

1. If the service principal was disabled due to administrative actions:
   - Navigate back to **Azure Active Directory** > **Enterprise applications**.

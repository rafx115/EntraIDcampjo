## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Here’s a detailed troubleshooting guide for the error code AADSTS160021, which indicates that a user session requested by an application does not exist.

### **Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS160021**

#### **1. Initial Diagnostic Steps**

Before attempting to troubleshoot this error, it’s essential to gather information to understand the context:

1. **Verify Error Context**:
   - Identify when the error occurs (e.g., during login, API call, etc.).
   - Determine which application is generating the error.

2. **Check User’s Current Session**:
   - Confirm if the user has an active session in Azure Active Directory (AAD).
   - Test the user's ability to log in through other means (e.g., Azure portal) to ensure no broader issues with their account.

3. **Account Status**:
   - Check if the user’s account is active and not locked or disabled.
   - Look for any potential issues with multi-factor authentication (MFA) or conditional access policies.

#### **2. Common Issues that Cause This Error**

- **Session Expiration**: User sessions may expire or time out after inactivity.
- **Token Mismanagement**: Issues with token handling or renewals, leading to attempts to access a session that no longer exists.
- **Account Deletion or Changes**: If the user’s account was altered or deleted while using the application, a valid session might not exist anymore.
- **Multi-Tenant Scenarios**: If the application is configured in a multi-tenant setup, ensure that the application is set up correctly to handle sessions for users from different tenants.

#### **3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies**

**Step 1: Create a New User Session**

- Encourage users to log out of the application entirely.
- Have the user log back into the application to create a new session.

**Step 2: Clear Cookies and Cache**

- Instruct users to clear their browser cookies and cache, which might help remove any outdated or corrupted session data.
- Additionally, have them try accessing the application in an incognito/private browsing session.

**Step 3: Review Application Registration**

- Go to Azure Active Directory in the Azure portal and check the application registration used by the app.
- Ensure the Redirect URIs are set correctly and that permissions are granted properly.

**Step 4: Check User Assignment**

- Ensure that the user is assigned to the application in Azure AD.
- If required roles or permissions are not assigned, you may need to adjust the access.

**Step 5: Verify Token Configuration**

- Check token settings for your application (e.g., expiration times, refresh tokens).
- If you have custom policies, ensure they allow token issuance as necessary.

**Step 6: Recreate the User Account (if necessary)**

- If the above steps do not resolve the issue, consider recreating the user account.
- Before doing this, ensure all data and permissions are backed up or documented.

#### **4. Additional Notes or Considerations**

- **Troubleshooting Environment**: If testing occurs in production, ensure that actions performed do not disrupt active users.
- **Logging**: Use adequate logging mechanisms to capture every error occurrence to identify trends or pinpoint the problem source.
- **Tenant Configuration**: In multi-tenant setups, ensure that the configurations accommodate user sessions from different tenants seamlessly.

#### **5. Documentation for Guidance**

- Microsoft Docs provide detailed guidance about Azure AD errors:
  - [Azure Active Directory Error Codes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aad-error-codes)
  - [Token Request Example](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow)

#### **6. Advice for Data Collection**

If issues persist and further investigation is needed:

- **Event Viewer Logs**:
  - On Windows, check the Event Viewer for any application logs that might indicate issues related to Azure AD authentication.
  
- **Network Traces**:
  - Use **NetTrace** or the **Fiddler** tool to capture traffic between the application and Azure AD. This can help identify if incorrect calls are being made or if responses are not handled correctly.

- **Log Insights**:
  - Collect logs/information about the user's session, including timestamps of login attempts and error occurrences.
  - If using Microsoft 365 or other linked services, make note of any relationship between those services and Azure AD during these transactions.

By following the steps outlined in this guide, you should be able to diagnose and resolve issues related to the AADSTS160021 error effectively.

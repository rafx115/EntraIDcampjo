# AADSTS81004: DesktopSsoIdentityInTicketIsNotAuthenticated - Kerberos authentication attempt failed.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide: Error Code AADSTS81004

#### Error Description:
AADSTS81004 - DesktopSsoIdentityInTicketIsNotAuthenticated: Kerberos authentication attempt failed.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Confirm the Error:** Ensure that the error code AADSTS81004 and the specific description about Kerberos authentication failure are accurate.
2. **Collect Information:** Gather details about the environment, such as the Active Directory setup, client configurations, and recent changes that might have affected authentication.

#### Common Issues:
1. **Misconfigurations:** Incorrect setups in the Active Directory or the client machines can lead to authentication failures.
2. **Expired Tickets:** Kerberos tickets might have expired or become invalid.
3. **Network Issues:** Problems in the network connectivity between the client and the authentication server can hinder the authentication process.
4. **User Permission Changes:** If user permissions have changed or if a user's account is disabled, Kerberos authentication can fail.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Check Kerberos Configuration:**
   - Verify that Kerberos configuration on both the client and server sides is correct.
   - Ensure that the time settings, Service Principal Names (SPNs), and keytab files are properly configured.

2. **Renew Kerberos Tickets:**
   - Have the users log out and log back in to acquire new Kerberos tickets.
   - If needed, manually renew the Kerberos tickets using the kinit command.

3. **Test Network Connectivity:**
   - Check the network connection between the client and the domain controller.
   - Ensure that there are no firewalls or other network devices blocking the Kerberos traffic.

4. **User Account Validation:**
   - Verify that the user accounts are active and have the necessary permissions for Kerberos authentication.
   - Check for any recent changes in user permissions or group memberships that could be causing the authentication failure.

5. **Review Logs:**
   - Analyze the event logs on both the client and server sides to identify any specific error messages related to the Kerberos authentication failure.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- **Service Accounts:** Ensure that service accounts used for authentication have the correct settings and permissions.
- **Double-check SPNs:** Service Principal Names must be correctly set up for the services to authenticate successfully.
- **Debugging Tools:** Utilize tools like Wireshark or Kerberos utilities for in-depth analysis of the authentication process.

# AADSTS81004: DesktopSsoIdentityInTicketIsNotAuthenticated - Kerberos authentication attempt failed.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS81004 Error

#### Description:
**AADSTS81004: DesktopSsoIdentityInTicketIsNotAuthenticated** indicates that a Kerberos authentication attempt has failed. This error usually arises in scenarios where users attempt to authenticate against Azure Active Directory (AAD) using Kerberos tickets typically in Single Sign-On (SSO) environments.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps:

1. **Identify the User Impact**: Determine if the issue is affecting a single user, a group, or all users. This helps narrow down the scope of the investigation.

2. **Check Authentication Methods**: Verify the authentication method being used (e.g., Kerberos, NTLM, etc.). Check if there has been any recent changes or updates in the authentication flow.

3. **Event Logs**: Review the local event logs (Windows Event Viewer) on the client machine to identify any related Kerberos or authentication errors.

4. **Reproduce the Issue**: Try to reproduce the error in a controlled environment if possible. This may help in understanding the context of the failure.

### Common Issues Causing this Error:

1. **Expired or Invalid Kerberos Tickets**: Users may have expired tickets, or for some reason, the tickets are not being recognized by AAD.

2. **Misconfigured Service Principal Names (SPNs)**: Ensure that SPNs are properly configured for the applications/service accounts involved in the Kerberos authentication.

3. **Wrong User Principal Name (UPN)**: Ensure that the UPN format being used matches the expected format in Azure AD.

4. **Clock Skew**: Ensure the system clock on the client and server is synchronized, as Kerberos is sensitive to time discrepancies.

5. **DNS Issues**: Ensure that there are no DNS resolution problems. Kerberos requires that the DNS settings are correct for the proper functioning of ticket requests.

6. **Domain Membership**: Ensure that the client device is correctly joined to the domain, and the user is part of the required security groups.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **Renew Kerberos Tickets**:
   - On a Windows client, run `klist` in the command prompt to check for the available tickets.
   - If tickets are expired or absent, run `klist purge` followed by either a log off/log on or `kinit` command to manually request a new ticket.

2. **Verify SPNs**:
   - Use the command `setspn -L <AccountName>` to check the SPNs assigned to the service account. Ensure they match the expected records.

3. **Check UPN Format**:
   - Ensure users logging in are using the correct UPN format as expected by Azure AD (e.g., user@domain.com).

4. **Time Synchronization**:
   - Check the time on the client machine and the domain controller using commands like `w32tm /query /status`. Synchronize if necessary.

5. **DNS Resolution**:
   - Ensure the DNS settings on the client point to the appropriate DNS servers. Check using `nslookup <hostname>`.

6. **Domain Join Verification**:
   - Verify that the machine is joined to the domain by accessing System Properties or using `whoami /fqdn`.

### Additional Notes or Considerations:

- Always test changes in a controlled environment before production changes.
- Ensure that any group policies related to Kerberos authentication are properly configured.
- Review Azure AD Connect or sync if dealing with hybrid configurations.

### Documentation for Guidance:

- Microsoft Docs on Azure AD Authentication: [Azure AD Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)
- Understanding and troubleshooting Kerberos: [Kerberos Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/kerberos-authentication)
- Troubleshooting Single Sign-On with Azure AD: [Troubleshoot SSO](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/tshoot-sso)

### Advice for Data Collection:

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Collect logs from "Windows Logs -> Application", "Security", and "System". Look for Kerberos-related errors.

2. **NetTrace for Networking Issues**:
   - Use tools like Wireshark or NetMon to capture network traffic that can help identify if the Kerberos packets are being sent/received correctly.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Utilize Fiddler to capture HTTP requests/responses between the client and Azure AD. This can give insight into failed HTTP authentication flows.

By following this structured troubleshooting guide, you can systematically identify and resolve the causes of the AADSTS81004 error.

# AADSTS81004: DesktopSsoIdentityInTicketIsNotAuthenticated - Kerberos authentication attempt failed.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS81004: DesktopSsoIdentityInTicketIsNotAuthenticated

#### Error Description
The AADSTS81004 error indicates that the Kerberos authentication attempt failed, which can happen in scenarios where the user's authentication ticket could not be validated. This error is often related to Single Sign-On (SSO) configurations in Azure Active Directory (AAD).

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check User Credentials**: Ensure that the user credentials used for authentication are valid and have not expired.
   
2. **Verify System Time**: Check that the system time on the client machine and the domain controller is correct. A significant time difference can cause Kerberos authentication to fail.

3. **Confirm Network Connectivity**: Make sure that the client device has network connectivity and can reach the necessary resources, including the AAD endpoints and domain controllers.

4. **Examine Event Logs**: Review the Event Viewer logs on the client machine (especially Security and Application logs) for any Kerberos-related errors or warnings.

5. **Check User Group Membership**: Ensure that the user is part of the appropriate Active Directory groups required for authentication and access to the necessary resources.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Stale Tickets**: Kerberos tickets can become stale and not be renewed properly, requiring a re-authentication.
   
2. **User Not in Active Directory**: If the user account is not present or not correctly configured in Active Directory, authentication will fail.

3. **Clock Skew**: If the client and server clocks are not synchronized, Kerberos tickets can be rejected.

4. **DNS Issues**: Kerberos relies on DNS for locating domain controllers. Issues with DNS resolution can lead to authentication failures.

5. **Service Principal Names (SPNs)**: If the SPNs are not correctly configured for the services being accessed, authentication can fail.

6. **Network Policies**: Firewall or network policies might prevent traffic to/from the authentication endpoints.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Validate User Credentials**:
   - Ensure the user's password is correct and that the account is not locked out.

2. **Check System Time**:
   - On the client machine, confirm that the time, date, and time zone settings are accurate. Use the command:
     ```bash
     w32tm /query /status
     ```
   - Ensure the client is synchronizing time with a reliable time source.

3. **Verify Network Connectivity**:
   - Test connectivity to the domain controller using:
     ```bash
     ping <domaincontroller_name>
     ```
   - Make sure nothing is blocking access to necessary endpoints (e.g., network firewall rules).

4. **Review Kerberos Tickets**:
   - Use the Kerberos ticket manager on the client by running:
     ```bash
     klist
     ```
   - Clear all tickets and renew them by running:
     ```bash
     klist purge
     ```

5. **Check DNS Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the client's DNS settings point to the correct DNS server.
   - Test DNS resolution with:
     ```bash
     nslookup <domaincontroller_name>
     ```

6. **Inspect SPNs**:
   - Ensure that SPNs are registered correctly in Active Directory. Use the command:
     ```bash
     setspn -L <ServiceAccount>
     ```
   - Register the SPN with appropriate commands if needed.

7. **Consult Policies**:
   - Review Group Policies and local security policies that may affect authentication.
   - Make sure that Kerberos policies are correctly set.

8. **Network-level Diagnostics**:
   - Use tools like Network Monitor or Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic to identify any points of failure during authentication.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Client Software**: Ensure that software providing SSO capabilities is up-to-date and properly configured.
- **Group Policy**: Changes in Group Policy can affect Kerberos authentication and should be reviewed.
- **Review Documentation**: Consult with your organization's documentation or Microsoftâ€™s documentation for any specific configurations or policies related to authentication.

### Advice for Data Collection

- **Logs**: Collect relevant logs from Event Viewer, especially Security and System logs to identify any Kerberos-related events.
- **Network traces**: Save the network trace for analysis; this can provide insights into what requests are being made and their responses.
- **Command Outputs**: Document outputs from troubleshooting commands like `klist`, `ping`, `nslookup`, and others for further analysis.

# AADSTS50155: DeviceAuthenticationFailed - Device authentication failed for this user.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50155 Error

#### Overview
The AADSTS50155 error is an authentication error indicating that the device authentication for the user has failed. This typically occurs when organizations enforce policies that require device registration or compliance checks before allowing access to resources.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Verify User Credentials**:
   - Ensure that the user is entering the correct username and password.
   - Check if the account is locked out or disabled.

2. **Check Device Registration**:
   - Verify if the device is registered in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
   - Confirm the device is compliant as per the organization's policies.

3. **Review Authentication Method**:
   - Determine if Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required and if the user has adequately completed the MFA steps.

4. **Confirm Licensing and Permissions**:
   - Ensure the user has the appropriate licenses assigned to access the resources.
   - Check if there are specific Conditional Access policies that may affect the user.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **Device Not Registered**:
   - The device the user is trying to authenticate from is not registered in Azure AD.

2. **Compliance Issues**:
   - The device does not meet the compliance requirements set by the organization (e.g., operating system version, antivirus status, etc.).

3. **Conditional Access Policies**:
   - There are Conditional Access policies that require specific conditions (e.g., location, device state) to be met for authentication.

4. **Account Issues**:
   - The user’s account might be in a bad state or not provisioned properly (e.g., synchronization issues).

5. **Network Issues**:
   - Temporary network problems may interfere with the authentication process.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Device Registration**:
   - Instruct the user to go to the Azure Portal and check if their device is registered.
   - If not registered, guide the user through the registration process (e.g., joining Azure AD or configuring Intune).

2. **Device Compliance**:
   - Check the organization’s compliance policies in the Endpoint Manager admin center.
   - Have the user ensure their device complies with these policies (e.g., install required updates, antivirus software).

3. **Review Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Analyze configured Conditional Access policies to see if any policies apply to the user or device.
   - Adjust policies as needed or provide alternative authentication options.

4. **Fix Account Issues**:
   - Check if the user's account is properly synchronized between on-premises AD and Azure AD.
   - Ensure there are no issues with the user's account status in Azure AD.

5. **User Profile and App Issues**:
   - Clear cached credentials and re-authenticate.
   - Consider recreating the user's profile on the device if there are persistent issues.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- If you determine that there is a need for device health attestation, ensure that the Intune policies are adequately configured.
- Network connectivity issues can be transient, so check if the user can authenticate from a different network.
- Encourage users to keep their devices updated and compliant with the organization's management policies.

#### Data Collection Advice
For troubleshooting, consider the following collections:
1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Check the Application and Services logs under Microsoft > Windows > User Device Registration for any relevant logs related to device registration issues.

2. **Network Traces**:
   - Use tools like **NetTrace** to capture network activity and check for blocked requests or failed authentications.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - If additional logging is needed, Fiddler can help capture HTTP(S) traffic; look for authentication calls to Azure AD and note the responses.

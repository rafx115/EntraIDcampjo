# AADSTS50158: ExternalSecurityChallenge - External security challenge was not satisfied.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50158 Error Code

**Error Description**:  
AADSTS50158 indicates that an external security challenge was not satisfied. This error is typically encountered during the authentication processes, particularly in scenarios using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) combined with conditional access policies or multi-factor authentication (MFA).

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Review Error Message**: Confirm the complete error message to gain context on when and where the issue occurred.
  
2. **Check User Status**: Verify if the user experiencing the issue is active and has the necessary permissions in Azure AD.

3. **Reproduce the Issue**: Attempt to replicate the error with the same user credentials to see if it occurs consistently.

4. **Confirm Application Configuration**: Ensure that the application registration in Azure AD is configured correctly.

5. **Check Network Connectivity**: Ensure that the device experiencing the problem has proper internet connectivity.

#### Common Issues that Cause AADSTS50158

1. **Conditional Access Policies**: Policies may require specific conditions (e.g. compliant devices, location-based access) that are not met.
  
2. **MFA Requirements**: Multi-factor authentication might be enabled but not completed by the user.

3. **Identity Protection Policies**: Risk-based conditional access policies may have been triggered, requiring additional verification.

4. **Expired Credentials**: The user's credentials might be expired and need to be updated.

5. **User Account Issues**: The user’s account might be locked or disabled.

6. **Insufficient Permissions**: The user may not have access to the resource they are attempting to authenticate against.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **User Verification**:
   - Ensure the user is not locked out or disabled in Azure AD.
   - Check if MFA is required and verify whether the user has properly set up MFA.

2. **Review Conditional Access Policies**:
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to **Azure Active Directory > Security > Conditional Access**.
   - Check if there are any policies that could be blocking the user or not being satisfied.

3. **Check Identity Protection Policies**:
   - In Azure AD, go to **Security > Identity Protection** and review any risk events associated with the user account.

4. **Reset MFA**:
   - If the user is having trouble with MFA, reset their MFA settings via **Azure AD > Users > [user] > Authentication methods**.
   - Have the user set up MFA again.

5. **Update User Credentials**:
   - Ask the user to change their password to ensure it’s valid if they have been experiencing issues logging in.

6. **Configuration Review**:
   - Verify that the application is set up in Azure AD properly under application registrations and API permissions.

7. **Device Compliance**:
   - Ensure the user is accessing the application from a compliant device if there are conditional access requirements.

8. **Audit Logs**:
   - Check Azure AD audit logs for any alerts or issues related to the user’s sign-in attempts.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **User Training**: Ensure users are familiar with MFA procedures and know how to respond to security challenges.
- **Regular Audit**: Periodically review conditional access policies and user account statuses.

#### Advice for Data Collection

To diagnose issues further, gather the following:

- **Event Viewer Logs**:
  - On the client machine, check `Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > AAD > Operational` for pertinent errors.

- **Network Traces**:
  - Use tools like **Nettrace** to capture network packets and examine the authentication flow for any anomalies.

- **Fiddler/HTTP Tracing**:
  - Configure **Fiddler** to capture and inspect HTTP traffic to identify failures in authentication requests, including the details of redirects and challenges encountered.

By following this guide, you should be able to methodically resolve the AADSTS50158 error and restore access to the resources in question.

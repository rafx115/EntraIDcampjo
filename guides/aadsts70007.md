# AADSTS70007: UnsupportedResponseMode - The app returned an unsupported value ofresponse_modewhen requesting a token.


## Troubleshooting Steps
**Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS70007: UnsupportedResponseMode**

**Error Description:**
The error code AADSTS70007 indicates that an application has returned an unsupported value for the `response_mode` parameter when requesting a token from Azure Active Directory (AAD). This typically means the application is misconfigured regarding how it handles responses during the authentication process.

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check the Response Mode Value**:
   - Examine the request to AAD to see what value is being sent for the `response_mode` parameter. It's critical to determine if it aligns with supported values.

2. **Review Application Documentation**:
   - Ensure that you understand the request flow of your application, including the authentication framework or library being used.

3. **Enable Logging**:
   - If possible, enable detailed logging for the authentication requests within your application or the surrounding infrastructure.

---

### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Unsupported Response Modes**:
   - The value provided for the `response_mode` parameter may not be supported (e.g., values like `fragment`, `form_post`, or `query`).

2. **Misconfiguration of OAuth2/OpenID Connect**:
   - Check if there have been recent changes to the configuration in Azure AD that may have affected the response modes.

3. **Library or Framework Defaults**:
   - Some authentication libraries may have default values set for `response_mode`. Ensure that these are compatible with the Azure AD configuration.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Identify and Validate `response_mode`**:
   - Check the code responsible for handling the token request. Validate that the `response_mode` is set to a supported value, such as `query`, `form_post`, or an appropriate value based on your application's authentication method.
   - Supported values can typically be found in Microsoft's documentation based on which flow is being used (e.g., Authorization Code Flow, Implicit Flow).

2. **Update Application Configuration**:
   - Modify your application's configuration or code to use a supported `response_mode`.
   - If using an SDK or library, check the latest documentation for updates and recommendations regarding `response_mode`.

3. **Testing Changes**:
   - After making changes to the application, test the authentication flow again to confirm that the issue is resolved. Use a tool like Postman to simulate requests if applicable.

4. **Log and Monitor**:
   - Implement monitoring for authentication issues and track the values being sent in requests for ongoing diagnostics.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Response Modes are Contextual**: The supported `response_mode` can differ based on the OAuth2/OpenID Connect flow being implemented. Be sure to check the appropriate context for your use case.
  
- **Libraries and SDK Updates**: Frequently review and update the libraries and SDKs used for authentication to ensure they follow the latest best practices.

### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Log Every Request and Response**:
   - Capture all relevant authentication requests and responses, especially those that fail. This should include headers, query parameters, and the response body for better comparison against the expected output.

2. **Capture Environment Details**:
   - Note the environment (development, testing, production) and any specific configurations unique to that environment that may impact token requests.

3. **User Feedback**:
   - If end-users report issues, gather information on their usage patterns to understand when the error occurs (e.g., specific actions, times).

4. **Azure Portal Diagnostic Logs**:
   - Enable diagnostic logging in Azure AD to retrieve additional context about the errors occurring during token requests.

By following this troubleshooting guide, you should be able to identify the cause of the AADSTS70007 error and implement a resolution effectively.

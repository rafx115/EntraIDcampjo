# AADSTS70007: UnsupportedResponseMode - The app returned an unsupported value ofresponse_modewhen requesting a token.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS70007: UnsupportedResponseMode

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify the App Registration:**
   - Access the Azure portal and navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations**.
   - Locate the application that is throwing the error.

2. **Check Application Configuration:**
   - Inspect the **Redirect URIs** configured for your application.
   - Review the **Response Type** that is set. Common response types include `code`, `token`, and `id_token`.

3. **Review API Permissions:**
   - Ensure that the necessary API permissions are granted and appropriately configured for the application.

4. **Clarify Authentication Flow:**
   - Identify the OAuth2 flow being used (Authorization Code, Implicit, Resource Owner Password Credentials, etc.).
   - Ensure that the selected flow aligns with the values being returned in the request.

#### Common Issues Causing This Error
1. **Incorrect Response Mode Value:**
   - The error may arise if the application's authentication request is using an unsupported `response_mode` parameter value. Common valid values include:
     - `query`
     - `fragment`
     - `form_post`
   
2. **Mismatched Response Mode and Response Type:**
   - Certain `response_types` can only work with specific `response_modes`. For instance:
     - `id_token` can be used with `fragment` or `form_post`.
     - `code` can be used with `query` or `form_post`.

3. **Misconfiguration in Code:**
   - The error might be due to a hard-coded or incorrect `response_mode` value in the application's authentication code.

4. **Token Endpoint Interactions:**
   - Sometimes issues with how the client interacts with the token endpoint can lead to unsupported response modes being sent.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Check and Update Response Mode:**
   - Review the code where the authentication request is made.
   - Update the `response_mode` to a supported value based on the requirements of your application.

2. **Align Response Mode and Response Type:**
   - Verify that the used `response_mode` aligns correctly with the `response_type` as mentioned above.

3. **Testing Different Environments:**
   - If applicable, test the authentication flow in different environments (development, staging, production) to reproduce and isolate the issue.

4. **Review Documentation and Resources:**
   - Refer to the Microsoft Identity platform documentation to understand the appropriate configurations for your authentication flow and supported response modes.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Always ensure your app registration settings in Azure AD are in sync with your application's authentication requests.
- Be aware that certain libraries or SDKs may have defaults that you need to override. 

#### Documentation and Guidance Resources
- [Microsoft Identity Platform Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/)
- [Authentication Scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)
- [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749)

#### Advice for Data Collection
When investigating issues related to the AADSTS70007 error, you may want to collect the following data:
- **Event Viewer Logs:**
  - Check the Event Viewer on your application server for logs related to authentication failures.
- **Network Traces:**
  - Use tools like Fiddler or Wireshark to log HTTP requests and responses during the authentication flow. Pay attention to the payload and ensure the parameters sent match the expected values.
- **.NET Trace:**
  - If your application is built on .NET, enable tracing for the Microsoft Identity libraries to gain insights into the error. Use `System.Diagnostics` to log detailed exception messages.
  
### Summary
By identifying the application, reviewing configurations, aligning the parameters used in authentication requests, and utilizing the available documentation and data collection strategies, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve the AADSTS70007 error.

  the necessary roles to the user.

##### 3. Review Service Provider Settings:

* **Verify Configuration:** Double-check the settings in the service provider's
  configuration to ensure they align with the desired access policies.
* **Adjust as Needed:** Make any necessary adjustments to the service provider
  settings based on the outbound access policy requirements.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:

  and review logs for additional insights into the issue.

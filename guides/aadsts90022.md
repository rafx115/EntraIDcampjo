# AADSTS90022: AuthenticatedInvalidPrincipalNameFormat - The principal name format isn't valid, or doesn't meet the expectedname[/host][@realm]format. The principal name is required, host, and realm are optional and can be set to null.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide for the error code `AADSTS90022`, which indicates an issue with the principal name format in an Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication scenario.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS90022

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Review the Error Message**:
   - Examine the full error message for clues about what part of the principal name is malformed.

2. **Check Principal Name Format**:
   - Verify the format of the user’s principal name being submitted during authentication. It should typically follow the format: `[name][@realm]`.
   
3. **Identify the Authentication Context**:
   - Note down where the error occurs (e.g., during sign-in, application access) and the application or service involved.

4. **Confirm User Status**:
   - Ensure the user account attempting authentication is active and not blocked, deleted, or disabled.

#### Common Issues that Cause this Error:
1. **Incorrect Principal Name Format**:
   - The principal name may have extra characters, missing components, or incorrect symbols.

2. **Null Values**: 
   - Host or realm values might inadvertently be set to null when they shouldn't be.

3. **Wrong Domain**:
   - The domain part of the principal name may not be recognized by AAD.

4. **Misconfigured Service or Application**:
   - The application’s registration in AAD might have configurations that don’t align with expected authentication parameters.

5. **Character Limitations**:
   - There could be an issue if special characters in the username or domain are not allowed.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Validate the Principal Name**:
   - Confirm the following:
     - The username is conforming to the expected format: `username@domain.com` or `username`.
     - Ensure no leading or trailing whitespace in the principal name.

2. **Examine the Application Configuration**:
   - Double-check the AAD application registration:
     - Go to Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > App Registrations > Select your Application.
     - Verify redirect URIs, permissions, and other authentication settings.

3. **Check Domain Settings in AAD**:
   - Ensure that the domain of the principal name is correctly added and verified in AAD.
   - Navigate to Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > Custom Domain Names to confirm the status of domains.

4. **Test with Different Credentials**:
   - Try using a different valid user to determine if the issue is specific to one user or more widespread.

5. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - On the server or machine where the issue is presented, access the Event Viewer:
     - Navigate to `Windows Logs` > `Application/System` to check for related error messages at the time of failure.
   - Look for warnings or errors related to authentication attempts.

6. **Collect Additional Network Traces**:
   - Use tools like Fiddler or WireShark to capture traffic during the authentication process.
   - Analyze the requests and responses, focusing on the properties of the request headers, especially the User Principal Name (UPN).

7. **Review Documentation and Logs**:
   - Read through Microsoft’s Azure AD documentation for the latest updates and troubleshooting scenarios:
     - [Azure AD Sign-in troubleshooting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/troubleshoot/authentication-scenarios)
     - [Error codes in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aadsts-error-codes)

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- Ensure Azure AD is up to date and check any recent updates or changes to policies.
- Monitor any changes made to the identity platform that might impact authentication.
- The issue might relate to specific Azure features (like Conditional Access) that may apply to the user's account.

#### Advice for Data Collection:
- **When using Event Viewer**:
   - Look for events specifically tagged with AAD or authentication codes during the times when failures occur.
  
- **When using Network Trace Tools like Fiddler**:
   - Capture and filter the traffic to find requests/response inducing the error.
   - Ensure you’re inspecting the correct ports, typically 443 for HTTPS requests.
  
- **For Nettrace**:
   - Employ it to track API calls related to AAD and any failure message generated to discern response discrepancies.

By following this detailed guide, you should be able to diagnose and troubleshoot the AADSTS90022 error effectively. If the problem persists after confirming all potential issues, consider escalating by opening a support ticket with Microsoft.

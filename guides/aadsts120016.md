## Troubleshooting Steps
**Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS120016 Error (PasswordChangeUserNotFoundBySspr)**

**Description:**
The error code AADSTS120016 indicates that during a Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) process, the system could not find the user account in Azure Active Directory (AAD). This can occur due to user input errors, misconfigurations, or account settings.

### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps
To begin troubleshooting, follow these initial diagnostic steps:

- **Validate the User Account**: Confirm that the user account exists in Azure Active Directory.
- **Check Authentication Method**: Ensure that the user is using the correct username/email format that corresponds to AAD.
- **Examine User Status**: Check if the user account is active and not disabled or deleted.
- **Revisit Password Reset Request**: Ensure the request for password reset is made by the correct user and that they are following the correct process.

### 2. Common Issues that Cause This Error
Some of the most common issues that lead to the AADSTS120016 error include:

- **Incorrect User Input**: The user may have entered the wrong username or email address.
- **Inactive or Deleted User Accounts**: Accounts that are disabled, deleted, or not properly synced may not be found.
- **Domain-Specific Issues**: Users belonging to an unsupported or incorrectly configured domain.
- **SSPR Configuration Issues**: Misconfigurations in the SSPR settings in Azure AD that prevent user recognition.

### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

#### Step 1: Confirm User Account Existence
- Log in to the Azure portal.
- Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Users**.
- Search for the user’s account. If not found, the account may be deleted or never existed.

#### Step 2: Check User Input
- Verify the email/username provided by the user is correct.
- Ensure there are no typos, and confirm proper format (e.g., user@domain.com).

#### Step 3: Review User Status
- Confirm that the account is not disabled.
- If the account is disabled, a global administrator must enable it.

#### Step 4: Validate SSPR Configuration
- In Azure AD, go to **Azure Active Directory** > **Users** > **Password reset**.
- Review the configuration settings, ensuring that SSPR is enabled appropriately for the user’s group or domain. 

#### Step 5: Examine Sync Status
- If your organization uses on-premises Active Directory sync with Azure AD, ensure that the synchronization is functioning properly.
- Use Azure AD Connect to check synchronization status and configurations.

### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations
- **AD FS Integration**: If using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), ensure that the integration is set up properly.
- **Security Policy Conflicts**: Check if security policies are incorrectly blocking user account recognition.
- **User License**: Ensure the user has the appropriate license assigned, which might impact their ability to access certain Azure AD features.

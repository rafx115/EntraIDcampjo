# AADSTS120016: PasswordChangeUserNotFoundBySspr


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS120016: "PasswordChangeUserNotFoundBySspr"

This error typically occurs in Azure AD when a user attempts to change their password using the Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) feature, but the specified user cannot be found in the directory. Below is a comprehensive guide to troubleshoot this issue.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Confirm User’s Existence**:
   - Verify that the user attempting to change their password is present in Azure Active Directory. You can do this through the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to `Azure Active Directory` > `Users` and search for the user by their UPN or email address.

2. **Check User Account Status**:
   - Ensure that the user's account is not disabled or deleted.
   - Look for the "Block sign in" setting on the user profile—it should be set to "No".

3. **Validate Domain Name**:
   - Ensure that the user is trying to log in with the correct domain. Mismatches can lead to not finding the user.

4. **SSPR Configuration**:
   - Check whether SSPR is correctly configured in your organization’s Azure AD settings.
   - Navigate to `Azure Active Directory` > `Security` > `Self-service password reset` and verify the settings defined for your users.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **User Not Present**: The user may have been deleted or their UPN might have changed without being updated correctly in related systems.

2. **Temporal Sync Issues**: If using directory synchronization (such as Azure AD Connect), there may be a delay in sync, leaving the user unrecognized.

3. **Configuration Errors**: Mistakes in SSPR configuration can lead to it not functioning correctly for certain users.

4. **Permission Issues**: The user may not have the necessary permissions or may not be part of the correct group that enables SSPR.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify User Exists**:
   - If the user does not exist, create the user account or restore the deleted user from a backup if applicable.

2. **Review User's Profile**:
   - If the user exists but is blocked or disabled, correct their account status.
   - If their UPN has changed, they may need to use their new credentials.

3. **Sync Issues**:
   - If using Azure AD Connect, check the sync status. Make sure synchronization is running properly and the user has been correctly synced.
   - You can force a sync using PowerShell: 
     ```powershell
     Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta
     ```

4. **Check SSPR Settings**:
   - Make sure that SSPR is enabled for the user's group or for all users as intended.
   - If specific group policies are set up, verify that the user belongs to those groups.

5. **Review Logs**:
   - Collect logs from Azure AD to troubleshoot or check for potential issues.
   - You can use Azure Monitor or Azure AD audit logs for this purpose.
   
6. **Testing**:
   - Have the user attempt to reset their password again after any changes, ensuring they are following the correct flow.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **User Training**: Ensure users are familiar with the password reset process, including what information they may need.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: If MFA is required and not configured, users will encounter issues during SSPR.
- **Network Issues**: Occasionally, a poor connection can affect the user’s ability to complete the password reset. Advise users to check their connectivity.

#### Documentation for Guidance

- Microsoft Documentation on SSPR: 
  - [Self-service password reset for Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-sspr-user)
- Azure Active Directory User Management:
  - [Manage users in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/users/groups/manage-groups)

#### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Collect application and system logs from the Event Viewer on Windows devices. Focus on issues under Applications and Services Logs, particularly for Azure AD services.

2. **Network Tracing**:
   - Use a tool such as **NetTrace** or **Fiddler** to capture network traffic if there is suspicion of issues with requests to the Azure AD service.
   - Look for failed requests, and review their response codes and messages to see what may be going wrong.

By following this guide, you should be able to effectively diagnose and resolve the AADSTS120016 error related to password change attempts. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Azure Support for further assistance.

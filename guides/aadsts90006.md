### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
=======
3. **Resolution Strategies**:
   - **Step 1**: Confirm that the issue is not specific to your environment by checking with other users or contacting the identity provider's support.
   - **Step 2**: If the issue is widespread, wait for some time and try again later as it might be a temporary service outage.
   - **Step 3**: Check your network connection to ensure there are no issues preventing communication with the authentication service.
   - **Step 4**: Clear browser cache and cookies or try using a different browser to rule out any local issues.
   - **Step 5**: If the issue persists, contact the identity providerï¿½s support for further assistance.

1. **Check Azure Status:**
   - Go to the [Azure Status Page](https://status.azure.com) to see if there are any ongoing service interruptions or outages affecting Azure AD services.

2. **Confirm the Time of Occurrence:**
   - Note the exact time when the error occurred. Temporary service issues may resolve quickly.

3. **Review Logs:**
   - Examine application and system logs to find related error metrics or patterns leading to the AADSTS90006 error.

4. **Reproduce the Error:**
   - Attempt to reproduce the error to establish its consistency. This can help in understanding if it's a systemic issue or not.

5. **Test Connectivity:**
   - Run network diagnostics to confirm that connectivity to Azure AD service endpoints is operational. Tools like `ping` or `tracert` may help check the network path.

### Common Issues That Cause this Error:

1. **Temporary Service Outages:**
   - Azure AD service experiencing temporary outages, which can affect application authentication requests.

2. **Service Throttling:**
   - Hitting the Azure AD API rate limits may lead to temporary failures.

3. **DNS Issues:**
   - DNS resolution problems may prevent proper communication with the Azure AD service.

4. **Network Configuration Issues:**
   - Firewalls, proxies, or network security groups that might block access to Azure services.

5. **Application Configuration Errors:**
   - Misconfigured Azure AD applications or invalid credentials might trigger error responses.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **Retry the Request:**
   - Since this is a retryable error, wait a few seconds to a minute and then retry the authentication request.

2. **Monitor Azure Status:**
   - If the Azure Status Page indicates an ongoing issue, wait for Microsoft to resolve the service outage before attempting again.

3. **Check for Configuration Issues:**
   - Ensure your application settings, such as redirect URIs, application secrets, and permissions are correctly configured in the Azure & its portal.

4. **Investigate Rate Limits:**
   - Review your application's use of Azure AD APIs and modify it to reduce the load if necessary.

5. **Examine Network Configuration:**
   - Verify that no outbound connections are being blocked to Azure AD endpoints. Test by accessing common Azure URLs and ensure they resolve correctly.

6. **DNS Resolution Tests:**
   - Flush your DNS cache and verify that DNS can resolve Azure AD services. Test by accessing Azure endpoints directly via the browser or using command-line tools (e.g., `nslookup`).

### Additional Notes or Considerations:

- Monitor for patterns when the issue occurs. If it's frequent but intermittent, additional logging and alerting in your application may be required.
- Be aware that retrying too quickly or too frequently can lead to throttling, further complicating the issue.

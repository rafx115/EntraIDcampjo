# AADSTS50139: SessionMissingMsaOAuth2RefreshToken - The session is invalid due to a missing external refresh token.


## Troubleshooting Steps
The AADSTS50139 error with the description "SessionMissingMsaOAuth2RefreshToken - The session is invalid due to a missing external refresh token" typically indicates that there is an issue with the user's authentication session, specifically related to a missing or expired refresh token from an external identity provider (such as Microsoft accounts). This error can prevent users from accessing resources that rely on Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication.

Here's a detailed troubleshooting guide to help diagnose and resolve this issue:

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Verify User Authentication:**
   - Check if the user in question can authenticate to other Azure services or applications using the same account.

2. **Examine the Application Logs:**
   - Review any application logs to see if the error occurs consistently or intermittently, and if it affects multiple users or only a specific user.

3. **User Account Status:**
   - Ensure that the user's account is in good standing and not locked or disabled in Azure AD.

### Common Issues that Cause this Error

1. **Expired or Missing Refresh Token:**
   - The application or service might not have a valid refresh token, either due to expiration or not requesting it properly during the authentication flow.

2. **Session Issues:**
   - A session might have expired, leading to the absence of a valid refresh token. This may happen if the user remains inactive for an extended period.

3. **Login Architecture:**
   - The application may be misconfigured to not use or handle refresh tokens appropriately.

4. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
   - If MFA is enabled, and there's a problem with the flow, it can trigger authentication issues.

5. **Token Scope:**
   - The scopes requested may not include permissions to get a refresh token, leading to a session missing this critical component.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Prompt User to Re-login:**
   - As the first step, ask the user to log out and then log back into the application. This should refresh their session and tokens.

2. **Check Application Configuration:**
   - Verify that the application is configured correctly in Azure AD:
     - Ensure that Redirect URIs and App ID URIs are accurately set.
     - Confirm that permissions and scopes include the necessary ones to request a refresh token.
  
3. **Adjust Token Lifetime Settings:**
   - Review the settings for token lifetimes in Azure AD. Ensure that refresh tokens are valid sufficiently long per your application’s needs.

4. **Implement Token Flow Correctly:**
   - Make sure that the application is using the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow correctly, including requesting both access tokens and refresh tokens.

5. **Review Application Secrets:**
   - If the application is using client credentials flow, ensure that the client secret has not expired or been revoked.

6. **Monitor for MFA Issues:**
   - Check if MFA prompts are being triggered and if users are able to complete the MFA challenge without issues.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Keep in mind that a lack of a refresh token is often temporary and may resolve itself through proper re-authentication.
- Depending on how your application handles session storage, cached tokens might need to be cleared to force a fresh login.

### Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer, Fiddler, etc.)

1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - Check for relevant logs in the Event Viewer, particularly under Applications and Services Logs, to capture any anomalies during token issuance.

2. **Network Traces:**
   - Use tools like Fiddler or Wireshark to capture traffic while replicating the issue. Look for requests to the token endpoints and examine the responses.

3. **Nettrace Tool:**
   - If you’re troubleshooting a .NET application, consider using the .NET tracing for Azure AD to track the request and response lifecycle.

4. **Client-Side Performance Logs:**
   - Review client-side performance logs to monitor any issues during the network requests for authentication and token retrieval.

Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS80014 -
OnPremisePasswordValidationAuthenticationAgentTimeout:

Initial Diagnostic Steps:

1. Verify the user credentials to ensure they are correct and have not expired.
2. Check if the user is able to log in using the same credentials on other
   applications or services.
3. Confirm there are no internet connectivity issues that might be causing
   delays in the authentication process.

Common Issues that Cause this Error:

1. Network latency or firewall restrictions causing delays in communication
   between the authentication agent and the Azure Active Directory (AAD)
   service.
2. Misconfiguration of the authentication agent settings or timeouts.
3. Overloaded authentication servers or resources leading to timeouts.
4. Incorrect configuration of the on-premises authentication infrastructure.

Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. Check the network connection between the on-premises authentication agent and
   the AAD service. Ensure there are no network latency issues or firewall
   restrictions blocking the communication.
2. Verify the settings of the authentication agent to see if the timeout values
   are configured correctly. You may need to adjust the timeout values to allow
   for successful validation requests.
3. Monitor the performance of the authentication servers to ensure they are not
   overloaded. Consider scaling up resources if needed.
4. Review the configuration of the on-premises authentication infrastructure to
   ensure it is properly set up to communicate with the AAD service.

Additional Notes or Considerations:

1. Open a support ticket with Microsoft Azure Support and provide the error
   code, correlation ID, and timestamp mentioned in the error message for
   further assistance.
2. Keep track of any changes or updates made to the authentication
   infrastructure that could have triggered the error.
3. Regularly monitor and test the authentication process to ensure it is
   functioning correctly and efficiently.
4. Consider implementing redundancy or failover mechanisms in the authentication
   setup to minimize the impact of any potential timeouts or failures.

# AADSTS80014: OnPremisePasswordValidationAuthenticationAgentTimeout - Validation request responded after maximum elapsed time exceeded. Open a support ticket with the error code, correlation ID, and timestamp to get more details on this error.


## Troubleshooting Steps
When dealing with the Azure Active Directory error code AADSTS80014, which indicates an "OnPremisePasswordValidationAuthenticationAgentTimeout", it's important to follow a structured troubleshooting process to identify and resolve the underlying issue effectively. Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide to help you address this error.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Observe the Error Context**: Take note of when and how the error occurs. Is it during a specific action or for specific users?
2. **Check the Correlation ID**: You may need this when opening a support ticket or reviewing logs. This ID helps in tracking the specific request through Azure's systems.
3. **Review the Timestamp**: Determine when the error occurred to correlate with logs or other events.

### Common Issues that Cause this Error

1. **Network Latency**: High latency or unreliable network connections can delay the responses from on-premises password validation.
2. **Service Outages**: There may be an outage or issue with Azure Active Directory services or the on-premises environment.
3. **Authentication Agent Configuration**: Incorrect or misconfigured Authentication Agents on-premise may lead to timeout errors.
4. **Server Performance**: Underlying performance issues on the server where the Authentication Agent is running (CPU, memory, etc.).
5. **Firewall and Proxy Issues**: Network/firewall configurations that block or slow down the communication between Azure and the on-premises agent.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Check Network Connectivity**:
   - Ensure that the on-premises Authentication Agent can communicate with Azure services without significant latency or dropped packets.
   - Use tools like `ping`, `tracert`, or network monitoring solutions to check connectivity.

2. **Increase Timeout Settings**:
   - If applicable, consider increasing the timeout settings in your environment to prevent premature timeouts.

3. **Review Authentication Agent Logs**:
    - Examine the logs from the on-premises Authentication Agent. Look for any warnings or errors at the time of the reported issue.
    - Logs are typically located in the installation directory of the Azure AD Connect or the Password Authentication Agent.

4. **Restart the Authentication Agent**:
   - Sometimes, a simple restart of the agent service can help resolve temporary issues.

5. **Validate Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the Authentication Agent is correctly configured. 
   - Check for updates or installation issues that may affect its performance.

6. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Assess the health of the server hosting the Authentication Agent. Look for high CPU or memory usage.
   - Use Windows Performance Monitor or any relevant monitoring tools.

7. **Check for Known Issues**:
   - Consult Microsoft documentation or support pages for any known issues related to the specific version of the Authentication Agent you are using.

8. **Open a Support Ticket**: 
   - If the issue persists and you cannot determine a fix, collect the necessary information including the error code, correlation ID, timestamp, and any relevant logs, and open a support ticket with Microsoft.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Implement reliability measures such as multiple Authentication Agents to balance the load and provide redundancy, reducing the likelihood of timeouts in the future.
- Regularly update your systems and keep the Authentication Agent updated to the latest version provided by Microsoft.

### Data Collection for Event Viewer Logs, NetTrace, Fiddler

1. **Event Viewer**: 
   - Navigate to Windows Event Viewer → Applications and Services Logs → Microsoft → Azure AD Connect.
   - Look for errors or warnings that correspond to the time of the issue.

2. **NetTrace**: 
   - Use a network tracing tool like NetMon or Wireshark to capture communication between the Authentication Agent and Azure services.
   - Analyze for dropped packets or long response times.

3. **Fiddler**: 
   - If applicable, use Fiddler to capture HTTP requests to see if there are issues with the responses from the Azure backend when authentication is attempted.

By following this guide, you should be able to isolate the cause of the AADSTS80014 error and implement the appropriate resolution steps.

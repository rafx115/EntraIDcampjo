# AADSTS120002: PasswordChangeInvalidNewPasswordWeak


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The error code AADSTS120002 with the description "PasswordChangeInvalidNewPasswordWeak" indicates that a password change attempt was unsuccessful because the new password does not meet the required complexity requirements defined in Azure Active Directory. Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide:

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify User Account**: Determine which user account is encountering this issue during the password change process.
2. **Review Password Policy**: Familiarize yourself with the password policies set in Azure Active Directory, including minimum length, complexity requirements (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters), and restrictions.
3. **Reproduce the Issue**: Attempt to change the password using the same password that the user tried to set. Note any error messages or feedback.

#### Common Issues Causing This Error
1. **Weak Password**: The new password does not meet the strength requirements.
2. **Password Restrictions**: The password may contain prohibited elements, such as the user’s name or common patterns.
3. **Complexity Requirements**: The organization’s password policy enforces strict complexity rules that the new password fails to satisfy.
4. **User Education**: The user may not be aware of the specific complexity requirements enforced by AAD.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Review the Password Policy**:
   - Log in to the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Users** > **Password reset**.
   - Check for policies regarding password length, character requirements, and any banned password lists.

2. **Educate Users**:
   - Inform the user about the complexity requirements for their new password.
   - Examples of requirements to communicate:
     - At least 8 characters (or the organization's specific requirement).
     - Must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.
     - Cannot contain easily guessable information (e.g., username or common words).

3. **Guidelines for Setting a Password**:
   - Encourage users to create passwords using a combination of unrelated words, characters, and symbols.
   - Utilize password managers to help generate strong passwords.

4. **Test Strong Passwords**:
   - If the user is unable to create a password that meets the requirements, test some known strong passwords that adhere to the policy.
   - Ensure that the password does not include parts of the user’s name or emails.

5. **Assist with Password Change**:
   - If the user is still facing issues, perform the password change on behalf of the user through the Azure portal, ensuring the new password meets the complexity requirements.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Make sure that any password the user intends to set is unique and hasn’t been used within a certain timeframe (if your organization has such a policy).
- Consider whether there are any recent updates to the policy that the user is not aware of.

#### Documentation for Guidance
- Refer to Microsoft’s documentation on Azure Active Directory password policies:
  - [Azure Active Directory Password Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-password-policy)
  - [Set up self-service password reset for Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-authentication-spr)

#### Data Collection & Monitoring Tools
- **Event Viewer Logs**: 
  - Check the security logs on the application servers to find specific logs related to failed login attempts or password change requests.
  
- **NetTrace**:
  - Capture a trace during the time a user attempts to change their password. This may reveal connectivity or authentication issues.

- **Fiddler**:
  - Use Fiddler to capture the HTTP requests/responses when a password change is attempted. Look for any anomalies in the request payload or response codes.

By following the above steps, you should be able to effectively troubleshoot and resolve the AADSTS120002 error related to weak passwords. Always keep the user informed and educated about the password policies in place.

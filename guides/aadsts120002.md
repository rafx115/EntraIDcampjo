## Troubleshooting Steps
**Error Code:** AADSTS120002 - PasswordChangeInvalidNewPasswordWeak

**Description:** This error occurs when attempting to change a password, but the new password is considered weak or does not meet the password strength requirements set by the system.

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:**
1. Verify the exact steps taken when changing the password.
2. Check that the new password meets the password policy requirements.
3. Make sure there are no typos or common words/phrases in the new password.
4. Confirm if the user is aware of the password policy and requirements.

**Common Issues Causing this Error:**
1. New password does not meet complexity requirements (lack of special characters, numbers, etc.).
2. Password is too short or easily guessable.
3. Repeated characters or sequences in the password.
4. System-specific password policy rules not followed.

**Step-by-step Resolution Strategies:**
1. **Reset the Password:**
   - Guide the user to reset their password with a new one that meets the complexity requirements.
   - Ensure they include a mix of uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   
2. **Check for Specific Password Policies:**
   - Review the password policy of the system or application where the password is being changed.
   - Ensure the new password adheres to all the necessary rules (e.g., minimum length, special characters requirement).

3. **Use Passphrase instead of Password:**
   - Encourage using passphrases as they can be longer and easier to remember, while still meeting security requirements.
   
4. **Avoid Common Words and Patterns:**
   - Advise against using common words, dictionary words, or easily guessable patterns in the password.
   - Suggest using a combination of random words or phrases for increased security.

5. **Educate and Inform Users:**
   - Ensure the user understands the importance of strong passwords for security.
   - Provide resources or guidelines for creating secure passwords.
   
**Additional Notes or Considerations:**
- Encourage users to use password managers to store and generate strong, unique passwords.
- Regularly update password policies to align with best practices and evolving security standards.

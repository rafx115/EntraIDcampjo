#### Description:

Error Code: AADSTS40010 Description: OAuth2IdPRetryableServerError - There's an

issue with your federated Identity Provider. Contact your IDP to resolve this
issue.


#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:

1. **Confirm the Error:** Make sure the error is consistent by attempting to

   authenticate multiple times.
2. **Check IDP Status:** Verify if the Identity Provider (IDP) is operational

   and not facing any outage or maintenance.
3. **Review IDP Configuration:** Check if the IDP configuration matches the

   requirements set by the federated service provider.
4. **Check Network Connectivity:** Ensure there are no network issues preventing

   successful communication between your application and the IDP.


#### Common Issues Causing this Error:

1. **Misconfigured IDP:** Incorrect settings or configurations in the IDP setup

   can lead to this error.
2. **IDP Service Outage:** Temporary or prolonged outages on the IDP side can

   cause authentication failures.
3. **Token Expiration:** Expired or invalid access tokens provided by the IDP

   can trigger this error.
4. **Network Issues:** Issues such as firewall restrictions or DNS problems can

   disrupt the authentication flow.


#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **Contact IDP Support:** Reach out to your Identity Provider's support team

   to investigate and fix any issues on their end.
2. **Review IDP Configuration:** Double-check the configuration settings on both

   the service provider and IDP sides to ensure they are aligned.
3. **Token Refresh:** If token expiration is the issue, try refreshing the

   tokens or obtaining new ones from the IDP.
4. **Troubleshoot Network:** Address any network-related issues that might be

   hindering the communication between your application and the IDP.
5. **Clear Cache and Cookies:** Sometimes clearing the cache and cookies of the

   browser used for authentication can resolve this error.
6. **Monitor Service Status:** Keep an eye on the status of the IDP to ensure

   that any temporary outages are noted and waited out.


#### Additional Notes or Considerations:

## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS67003: ActorNotValidServiceIdentity

**Error Code:** AADSTS67003  
**Description:** ActorNotValidServiceIdentity

This error typically occurs when there is an issue with the identity of the service attempting to authenticate to Azure Active Directory (AAD). The problem suggests that the identity, often a service principal or application identity, is not recognized or is invalid.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check the Error Message:** Review the full error message for specific details about what might be invalid about the actor (identity).
2. **Identify the Actor:** Determine which service identity is implicated in the error. It might be a service principal, managed identity, or another application identity.
3. **Review the Context:** Analyze the context in which the error occurred. Was it during an API call, when accessing Azure resources, or during a configuration action?

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Invalid or Non-Existent Service Principal:** The service principal might not exist in the Azure AD tenant.
2. **Expired Credentials:** The credentials (secrets/certificates) used for the service identity may have expired.
3. **Permission Issues:** The service principal may lack the necessary permissions or roles to perform the requested action.
4. **Misconfigured Application Registration:** The application registration might have configuration issues, such as incorrect redirect URIs or scopes.
5. **Conditional Access Policies:** Any applied policies that restrict access might be leading to the error.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify the Service Principal:**
   - Log in to the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations.
   - Search for and select the service principal in question.
   - Verify that it exists and is active.

2. **Check Credentials:**
   - Under the selected application, go to "Certificates & Secrets".
   - Ensure that the client secret has not expired. If it has, create a new one and update your application’s configuration.

3. **Review API Permissions:**
   - Still within the app registration, navigate to "API permissions".
   - Check that the necessary permissions for the application to perform its required tasks are granted.
   - If permissions are missing, add them and ensure they are granted admin consent if necessary.

4. **Application Registration Configuration:**
   - Check the "Authentication" section to verify that the redirect URIs and other settings are correct.
   - Ensure that the application has the correct application ID URI if required.

5. **Assess Conditional Access Policies:**
   - Look for any conditional access policies that may restrict access based on certain criteria.
   - If needed, test the identity outside of those policies to ensure they are not the cause.

6. **Use Azure AD Sign-In Logs:**
   - Navigate to Azure Active Directory > Sign-ins in Azure portal.
   - Check for logs related to the service principal to get insights into any additional errors or blocking issues.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Ensure that your application is correctly configured to use the appropriate authentication flow for your needs, be it OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, etc.
- Understand the scopes and roles in Azure AD and how they affect your service principal’s permissions. 
- Be cautious of any pending or ongoing maintenance in the Azure environment that might influence your service principal’s operation.

- [Permissions and consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-app-permissions)

#### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - Check the Windows Event Viewer for any application errors related to authentication or Azure AD errors.
   - Common locations include "Applications and Services Logs" -> "Microsoft" -> "AzureAD".

2. **Network Trace (Nettrace):**
   - Use Azure Network Watcher, if applicable, to monitor network connectivity and verify communication with Azure AD endpoints.

3. **Using Fiddler:**
   - If Fiddler is installed, run it to trace the API requests made by your application to Azure AD, looking for failures or unexpected responses.

By following these steps systematically, you should be able to resolve the error code AADSTS67003 efficiently. If issues persist, consider reaching out to Azure support for further assistance.

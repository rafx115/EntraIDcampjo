# AADSTS700005: InvalidGrantRedeemAgainstWrongTenant - Provided Authorization Code is intended to use against other tenant, thus rejected. OAuth2 Authorization Code must be redeemed against same tenant it was acquired for (/common or /{tenant-ID} as appropriate)


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS700005: InvalidGrantRedeemAgainstWrongTenant

#### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps
- **Verify the Error Message**: Confirm that the error received is indeed AADSTS700005. This error indicates that an OAuth 2.0 authorization code obtained from one tenant is attempted to be used with a different tenant.
- **Identify the Tenant IDs**:
  - Check the tenant ID associated with the authorization code.
  - Identify the tenant ID that the request is being sent to when redeeming the authorization code.
  
#### 2. Common Issues that Cause this Error
- **Cross-Tenant Usage of Authorization Code**: The most frequent cause is an authorization code that was acquired for one tenant (e.g., Tenant A) being used in a request to a different tenant (e.g., Tenant B).
- **Misconfigured Client Application**: If the application is configured to access multiple tenants but is incorrectly routing requests, it can lead to this error.
- **Incorrect Redirect URI**: If the redirect URI used during authorization does not match the expected URI in the tenant's application registration.
- **Use of /common endpoint incorrectly**: If your application is set to use the /common endpoint during authorization but you are trying to redeem the code against a specific tenant.

#### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Confirm the Authorization Code**:
   - Ensure the code was obtained from the intended tenant by checking the response from the OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint.
  
2. **Check the Application Configuration**:
   - Go to the Azure Portal.
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations**.
   - Verify that the application is registered correctly in the target tenant.

3. **Match Tenant IDs**:
   - When exchanging the authorization code, confirm that the request is directed to the correct tenant endpoint (i.e., use either:
     - `/common` if your application supports multi-tenancy.
     - Or use `/{tenant-ID}` for single-tenant apps).
   - Make sure the tenant ID matches the one associated with the authorization code.

4. **Check Redirect URI**:
   - Ensure that the redirect URI registered in Azure AD for the application matches the one used in the authorization request.

5. **Application Permissions**:
   - Check if the necessary permissions are granted for the application in that tenant.

6. **Cross-Tenant Configuration**:
   - If developing for multiple tenants, verify if the application can support multi-tenant login flows.

#### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that the client application is not unintentionally mixing tenants (such as having users sign in from different tenants without proper handling).
- Consider maintaining separate environments as a means to avoid cross-tenant issues.

#### 5. Documentation Where Steps Can Be Found for Guidance
- [Microsoft Identity Platform Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/).
- [Azure Active Directory B2C authentication flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/user-flow-overview).
- [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow).

#### 6. Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer Logs, NetTrace, Fiddler)
- **Event Viewer Logs**:
  - Monitor the applicationâ€™s event log for logs related to authentication. This may provide insights on requests and potential mismatches.
  
- **NetTrace**:
  - Use tools like NetTrace or Wireshark to capture network traffic and analyze the request/response cycle when attempting to redeem the authorization code.
  
- **Fiddler**:
  - You can use Fiddler to monitor HTTP(s) traffic. Ensure to capture requests made to the Azure authorization endpoints, checking headers and body to verify that the correct tenant and application details are being sent.

By following this guide, you should be able to identify the root cause of the AADSTS700005 error and implement an appropriate resolution.

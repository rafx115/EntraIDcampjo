# AADSTS50049: NoSuchInstanceForDiscovery - Unknown or invalid instance.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide for the error code **AADSTS50049** with the description **"NoSuchInstanceForDiscovery - Unknown or invalid instance."**

### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps
Before proceeding with troubleshooting, follow these initial diagnostic steps:

- **Check the Error Context**:
  - Identify when the error occurs (e.g., during login, application access).
  - Check which application or service is triggering the error.

- **Verify User Credentials**:
  - Ensure that the user is entering the correct username and password.
  
- **Review Client Application Configuration**:
  - Confirm that the application is registered correctly in Azure AD.
  - Validate the Redirect URIs and API Permissions.

### 2. Common Issues That Cause This Error
Several common issues might lead to the AADSTS50049 error:

- **Incorrect Instance URL**:
  - The application is using an incorrect Azure AD instance (tenant) URL.

- **Malformed Sign-in URL**:
  - The sign-in URL may be malformed or may point to the wrong endpoint.

- **Expired or Misconfigured App Registration**:
  - The application registration might have issues like an expired certificate, invalid API permissions, or incorrect redirect URIs.

- **Network Issues**:
  - Issues related to DNS resolution or firewall settings may disrupt connectivity to the Azure AD.

### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

#### Step 1: Verify Instance URL
- Check the instance URL being used for authentication. Ensure that it follows this format:
  ```
  https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}
  ```
- Replace `{tenant-id}` with your specific tenant ID, or you can use the tenant domain (e.g., `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`).

#### Step 2: Inspect the Application Configuration
- In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Azure Active Directory** section.
- Go to **App registrations**, and find the application that is experiencing the problem.
- Ensure that:
  - The Registration (Application ID) and Redirect URIs are correct.
  - All necessary permissions are granted.
  - Make sure the application has been given the appropriate API permissions.

#### Step 3: Review the Authentication Flow
- If you are using libraries like Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL), ensure they are properly configured to use the updated instance and endpoint URLs.

#### Step 4: Check Network Connectivity
- Validate that there is no network or firewall blocking communication with Azure AD.
- Use tools like `ping` or `nslookup` to check if you can reach the Azure login URLs.

#### Step 5: Review Logs and Event Viewer
- Investigate logs on the client-side or server-side to gather more information about the error.
- Look for any specific error messages or codes that might provide more context.

### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that you review the documentation specific to the SDK or library being used as they may have unique configurations.
- Consider any recent changes to either the application or Azure AD settings that may have affected this.

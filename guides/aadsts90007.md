Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS90007 (InvalidSessionId - Bad request)

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Verify the Error Context:** Understand where and when the error occurs, whether during login, token issuance, or API access.
2. **System Logs:** Check system logs for any related information that might provide additional context on the error.
3. **Session Management:** Review current session management processes and configurations for the application that is encountering the error.
4. **Review Recent Changes:** Identify any recent changes, updates, or configurations made that might have impacted session handling or token validation.

**Common Issues that Cause this Error:**

1. **Session Token Format Mismatch:** The session token format may not be matching the expected format defined by the authentication service.
2. **Expired or Invalid SessionID:** The session ID passed might have expired or is not valid.
3. **Authentication Service Configuration:** Incorrect configuration settings in the authentication service might be causing the error.
4. **Network or Connectivity Issues:** Network disruptions or connectivity problems could prevent proper parsing of the session ID.
5. **Client-Side Data Manipulation:** Tampering with session IDs on the client-side can lead to parsing errors during authentication.

**Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:**

1. **Check Session Token Format:** Ensure that the session token being passed conforms to the required format specified by the authentication service.
2. **Verify Session Expiry:** Confirm that the session ID has not expired, and if it has, initiate a new authentication flow to generate a valid session token.
3. **Review Authentication Service Configurations:** Double-check the configurations and settings in the authentication service to ensure they align with the application's requirements.
4. **Network Troubleshooting:** Resolve any network issues or connectivity problems that might be interfering with the parsing of the session ID.
5. **Client-Side Validation:** Implement client-side validation mechanisms to prevent tampering with session IDs.

**Additional Notes or Considerations:**

- **Token Revocation:** If session tokens are being revoked or invalidated by the authentication service, ensure proper handling to avoid invalid session ID errors.
- **Token Refresh Mechanism:** Implement a token refresh mechanism to generate new session IDs when needed, especially if using long-lived tokens.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Set up logging and monitoring to track authentication-related activities and errors for better troubleshooting in the future.

By following these steps and considering the common issues and resolutions provided, you should be able to diagnose and address the error code AADSTS90007 effectively.

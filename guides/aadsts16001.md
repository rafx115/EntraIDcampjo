When triggered, this error allows the user to recover by picking from an updated list of tiles/sessions, or by choosing another account. This error can occur because of a code defect or race condition.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Hereâ€™s a detailed troubleshooting guide for the AADSTS16001 error code:

### AADSTS16001 Troubleshooting Guide

#### Overview
AADSTS16001 indicates that the user attempted to select a tile (session) that has been invalidated by the system's logic. The user should be able to recover by selecting a valid option from the available tiles. 

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Reproduce the Issue**: Attempt to reproduce the error by going through the same steps that led to the error.
2. **Check the User Account**: Verify the account that is being used to sign in. Ensure that it is not locked or disabled.
3. **Browser Check**: Ensure the user is using a supported browser. Clear the cache and cookies or try a different browser.
4. **Session State**: Confirm if the error is consistent across different sessions or browsers.
5. **Examine the Tiles**: Look at the tiles available for selection. Determine if there is an inconsistency or unexpected state in the application.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **Session Management Issues**: Issues where the session state is not being properly maintained or updated.
2. **Code Defects**: Bugs or issues in the application code that handle user session selection.
3. **Race Conditions**: Situations where events are competing and producing unexpected results, leading to an invalid state when a user selects a tile.
4. **User Data Permissions**: If the user may not have access rights to the tile they are trying to select.
5. **Authentication Token Expiration**: If the user's authentication tokens are not valid.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Update the Application**: Ensure that the application is up to date. Apply any recent patches or updates that might address bugs or session handling improvements.
2. **User Selection Logic Review**: Check the logic that handles session selection. Look for any cases where inputs can lead to an invalid state.
3. **Additional Logging**: Implement or increase logging around the selection process to capture details of what happens when a tile is selected.
4. **Session Management Review**: Investigate how sessions are being managed. This includes looking for any race condition or stale session data that might be interfering with selection.
5. **Review User Permissions**: Ensure that the user has appropriate access rights for the tiles available.
6. **Validation of Input**: Ensure that any input from the user is properly validated before processing the request.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that users are aware of the error and provide them clear instructions on how to retry their selection if this occurs.
- If the issue persists, consider a wider systemic review of the session and authentication mechanisms in use.

#### Documentation for Guidance
- Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AAD) documentation can provide insights on error codes and troubleshooting suggestions:
  - [Azure Active Directory Error Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aad-error-codes)
  - [Authentication and Authorization documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)
  
#### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**: Check the Event Viewer on the server hosting the application for any relevant logs. Look under Windows Logs -> Application for application-specific entries.
- **Network Traces**: Use tools like NetTrace to capture networking activity and identify any issues during the authentication flow.
- **Fiddler or Network Analyzers**: Use Fiddler to watch HTTP/HTTPS traffic and identify any anomalies in the requests/responses relating to the tile selection process, such as unexpected redirects or error responses.

By following this guide, you will have thorough coverage of diagnosing and addressing the AADSTS16001 error, ensuring a clearer path for resolution and avoidance.

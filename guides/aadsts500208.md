## Troubleshooting Steps
Here's a detailed troubleshooting guide for the error code AADSTS500208 - "The domain is not a valid login domain for the account type":

### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Confirm User Account Type:** Verify the account type being used for sign-in (work/school account or personal Microsoft account).
2. **Check Tenant Configuration:** Ensure that the Azure Active Directory (AAD) tenant is set up to allow the type of accounts that the user is trying to sign in with.
3. **Review Error Message:** Pay attention to any additional details in the error message that might provide clues on the specific domain or account type mismatch.

### Common Issues Causing the Error:

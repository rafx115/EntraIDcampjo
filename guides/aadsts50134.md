# AADSTS50134: DeviceFlowAuthorizeWrongDatacenter - Wrong data center. To authorize a request that was initiated by an app in the OAuth 2.0 device flow, the authorizing party must be in the same data center where the original request resides.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The error code AADSTS50134 describes a situation where an app using the OAuth 2.0 device flow has been initiated in one data center, but the authorization request is being made from another data center. Here is a detailed troubleshooting guide to resolve this issue.

### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS50134

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify the Application**: Determine the application that is experiencing the issue and its intended functionality.
  
2. **Check the Flow**: Review the OAuth 2.0 device flow implementation details. Make sure you understand how the device flow is being initiated and how the authorization is expected to take place.
  
3. **Data Center Location**: Identify the data center of both the application and the authorization service. This may involve knowing where your application is hosted or the Azure service it's using.

4. **Azure Configuration**: Confirm if your Azure Active Directory (AAD) setup reflects the correct data center settings. This may include the Azure Region for both the app registration and the resources being accessed.

#### Common Issues that Cause this Error

1. **Region Mismatch**: The application's registration and the AAD tenant might be in different Azure regions/data centers.

2. **Network Configuration**: Network settings might route requests differently based on geographical location. 

3. **Temporary Issues**: Occasional outages or issues in a specific Azure region can lead to request failures.

4. **Misconfigured Redirect URI**: The redirect URI set in the app registration may not match the expected endpoints, potentially causing authorization redirect issues.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Confirm the Regions**:
   - Go to the Azure portal.
   - Check the resource group's location where your app resides.
   - Check the Azure AD tenant location settings.

2. **Reconfigure if Necessary**:
   - If the app and the AAD tenant are in different data centers, consider:
     - Migrating the application to the same region as the AAD tenant.
     - Creating a new AAD tenant in the same data center as your application.

3. **Test Connectivity**:
   - Use networking tools to verify that requests from your application can reach the AAD service.
   - Check if there are any firewalls, proxies, or network routes that might impede the request delivery.

4. **Validate App Registration**:
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to "Azure Active Directory" > "App registrations".
   - Check the "Redirect URIs" and ensure they match the expected patterns used in your device flow authorization.

5. **Audit Logs**:
   - Check the Azure Active Directory audit logs to see if there are any additional indicators of issues that may assist in troubleshooting the problem.

6. **Retry Authorization**:
   - Initiate the device flow authorization again, ensuring that the initiating and authorizing requests originate from compatible locations.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Documentation Review**: Regularly check Azure's official documentation regarding OAuth 2.0 device flow for any updates or additional configuration requirements.

- **User Training**: Ensure that users initiating the device flow understand the specific steps and requirements, including where to complete the authorization.

#### References to Documentation

#### Advice for Data Collection

- **Event Viewer Logs**: 
  - Check the Event Viewer on the servers running your application for any relevant logs about authentication failures.
  
- **Network Traces**: 
  - Use tools like `nettrace` or Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic if you suspect network issues are occurring.
  
- **Fiddler**: 
  - Utilize Fiddler to monitor HTTP requests/responses during the authorization process to see if there are any anomalies or failures in the communication with AAD.

By following these steps and referencing pertinent documentation, you should be able to troubleshoot and resolve the AADSTS50134 error effectively. If the problem persists after following this guide, consider reaching out to Microsoft Support for more specialized assistance.

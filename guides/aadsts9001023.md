# AADSTS9001023: The grant type isn't supported over the /common or /consumers endpoints. Please use the /organizations or tenant-specific endpoint.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS9001023

The error code **AADSTS9001023** indicates that the grant type requested is not supported over the `/common` or `/consumers` endpoints. This happens when the application is trying to use an authorization flow that is not applicable to the type of endpoint used. This guide will help you troubleshoot and resolve this issue.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify the Grant Type**: Determine what grant type your application is trying to use. Common grant types include authorization code flow, implicit flow, client credentials, etc.
   
2. **Verify Endpoint Utilization**: Check which endpoint your application is using. The `/common` and `/consumers` endpoints are meant to support personal Microsoft accounts or multi-tenant scenarios but may not support some grant types.

3. **Check Application Registration**: Ensure that your application is properly registered in Azure Active Directory (AAD) and that it is configured to support the required grant types.

4. **Review Error Context**: Look for additional details or context surrounding the error in the application's logs or response to gain insights into what specifically might be causing the issue.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **Using `/common` endpoint for organizational accounts**: Grant types that require organization-specific authorization (like client credentials) must call either the `/organizations` endpoint or a tenant-specific endpoint.
   
2. **Non-Configuration of Grant Types**: The application may not be set up to support the grant type being requested.

3. **Misconfigured Redirect URIs**: Redirect URIs may not match what is configured in the AAD application settings, potentially leading to failed authentication flows.

4. **Using Client Credentials without Permissions**: If your application uses the client credentials grant, make sure that it has the necessary API permissions granted.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Change the Endpoint**:
   - If you are using the `/common` endpoint, switch to `/organizations` for organizational accounts.
   - Alternatively, you can specify a tenant-specific endpoint like `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant_id}`.

2. **Update Application Permissions**:
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to "Azure Active Directory" > "App registrations".
   - Find your application and check the "API permissions" section. Ensure it has the permissions that are required for the grant type you are using.

3. **Register Grant Types**:
   - Check the "Authentication" section of your app registration and ensure that the allowed token flows (like authorization code, implicit, etc.) are enabled for your application.

4. **Check Redirect URIs**:
   - Within the Azure portal under App registrations, check the "Authentication" blade and ensure that the redirect URIs match what's being used by your application.

5. **Testing**:
   - After making changes, test the application again to see if the error is resolved.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Multi-Tenant Applications**: If your application is multi-tenant, ensure it can appropriately handle both personal Microsoft accounts and organizational accounts. You may need to handle these cases distinctly.
- **Developer Environment**: Ensure that development and production configurations are aligned, especially concerning the endpoints used and application settings.
- **Security**: Be cautious with the permissions you grant to your application to ensure it adheres to the principle of least privilege.

#### Advice for Data Collection

- **Event Viewer Logs**: If you have access to the system where the app is running, check the Event Viewer for logs related to application errors or security auditing that might provide additional context.
  
- **Network Trace (Nettrace)**: You can use tools like Wireshark to capture traffic to and from your application to analyze HTTP requests/responses for any discrepancies in token requests.

- **Fiddler**: Using Fiddler can help you inspect and debug web traffic, especially the request to the token endpoint that may be causing the error. It allows you to review the headers and payload that are sent in the request.

By following this troubleshooting guide, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the issue associated with the AADSTS9001023 error effectively.

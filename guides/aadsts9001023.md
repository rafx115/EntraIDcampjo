# AADSTS9001023: The grant type isn't supported over the /common or /consumers endpoints. Please use the /organizations or tenant-specific endpoint.


## Troubleshooting Steps
**Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS9001023:**

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:**
1. **Verify Endpoint**: Check if the authentication request is using the correct endpoint (/organizations or tenant-specific) instead of /common or /consumers.
2. **Check Grant Type**: Ensure that the grant type specified in the authentication request is supported by the endpoint being used.
3. **Review Application Configuration**: Verify the application settings to confirm that the correct authentication settings are configured.

**Common Issues:**
- Incorrect endpoint being used in the authentication request.
- Mismatched grant type in the authentication request with the endpoint's supported types.
- Misconfigured application settings causing the request to be sent to the wrong endpoint.

**Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:**
1. **Update Authentication Request**: Modify the authentication request to use the /organizations or tenant-specific endpoint based on the error message.
2. **Check Grant Type**: Ensure that the grant type specified in the authentication request matches the supported types for the chosen endpoint.
3. **Verify Application Configuration**: Review the application configuration to make sure the correct endpoint and grant type are set up.
4. **Test Authentication**: Perform a test authentication after making the necessary changes to confirm the issue has been resolved.

**Additional Notes or Considerations:**
- Keep in mind that the /common and /consumers endpoints do not support all grant types, so it's essential to use the appropriate endpoint based on the authentication requirements.
- If using Azure Active Directory for authentication, familiarize yourself with the different endpoint options and their limitations.

**Documentation for Guidance:**
- Microsoft Azure Active Directory Documentation: [Authentication Scenarios for Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)
- Azure Active Directory endpoints documentation: [Azure AD Endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-authorization-endpoints)

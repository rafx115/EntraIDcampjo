# AADSTS90023: InvalidRequest - The authentication service request isn't valid.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Troubleshooting the AADSTS90023 error, which indicates that "The authentication service request isn't valid," involves several steps to identify and resolve the underlying issues. Here’s a comprehensive guide to address this error:

### **Initial Diagnostic Steps**

1. **Understand the Context:**
   - Note the environment where the error occurs (web app, mobile app, etc.).
   - Identify the specific action that triggered the error (e.g., login attempt, token request).

2. **Check the Request:**
   - Review the request payload and parameters.
   - Ensure there are no obvious syntax errors or omissions in the request.

3. **Review User Account:**
   - Check if the user experiencing the problem has an active account in Azure AD.
   - Confirm the user's credentials and that they are not locked out or disabled.

### **Common Issues That Cause This Error**

1. **Invalid Request Parameters:**
   - Missing or incorrect parameters in the authentication request (like redirect URI, client ID, scope, etc.).

2. **Malformed Authentication URL:**
   - Issues with the structure of the request URL or incorrect use of granted OAuth2 scopes.

3. **Application Registration Issues:**
   - Problems with the app registration in Azure AD (misconfigured redirect URIs, incorrect secrets, disabled application, etc.).

4. **Token Endpoint Configuration:**
   - Misconfiguration of the endpoints for acquiring tokens, like using a deprecated endpoint.

5. **Expired Redirect URL:**
   - The redirect URL provided in the request might be outdated or has changed.

### **Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies**

1. **Review and Correct Request Parameters:**
   - Validate the request by checking all parameters (client ID, redirect URI, response type, scope).
   - Ensure that the redirect URI matches exactly what is registered in Azure AD.

2. **Check Application Registration:**
   - Log in to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations**.
   - Select your application and review:
     - The client ID.
     - The redirect URI and ensure it matches the request.
     - Permissions (API permissions > Grant admin consent).
     - Check if the application is enabled.

3. **Inspect Token Request:**
   - Ensure you are using the correct grant type for the OAuth2 flow.
   - Verify all required parameters are included in the token request.

4. **Examine API Permissions:**
   - Ensure that the application has the required permissions granted in Azure AD.
   - Make sure the requested scopes are correctly specified.

5. **Test Authentication Flow:**
   - Utilize tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to manually test the OAuth2 flow.
   - Use appropriate endpoints for token acquisition and verify the responses.

### **Additional Notes or Considerations**

- **Environment Consistency:**
  Ensure that you are testing the same environment (development vs. production) and that configurations are consistently applied across environments.

- **Browser or Token Cache:**
  Clear cache or try a different browser if the error persists after making changes. Also, if using a token, ensure it is not expired.

- **Verbose Error Logs:**
  Enable logging in your application or API to capture detailed error messages that can provide insights into what is wrong.

### **Advice for Data Collection**

- When troubleshooting, collect the following information:
  - Full error message and stack traces (if applicable).
  - Complete request and response logs, specifically before and after the error occurred.
  - User account details (without sensitive information) to assess if it’s user-specific.
  - Configuration details of the Azure AD app registration.
  - Time of occurrence, as this may also relate to any recent changes made to the application or Azure settings.

By following these steps, you can systematically diagnose and resolve the AADSTS90023 error to restore proper authentication functionality in your application.

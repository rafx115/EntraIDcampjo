**Description**: "InvalidRequest - The authentication service request isn't valid."

---

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Verify the Request URL:**
   - Check the URL used for the authentication request. Ensure it is formatted correctly and is pointing to the right Azure AD endpoint.

2. **Check the Client ID and Secret:**
   - Confirm that the Client ID and Client Secret used in the request are correct and belong to the registered application in the Azure portal.

3. **Review the Redirect URI:**
   - Ensure the redirect URI specified in the authentication request matches one of the redirect URIs registered in the Azure portal.

4. **Examine Required Parameters:**
   - Make sure all required parameters (like `response_type`, `scope`, `client_id`, etc.) are included in the request.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Malformed Request:**
   - The HTTP request has an incorrect format or is missing required parameters.

2. **Incorrect Client Application Configuration:**
   - The application is incorrectly configured in the Azure portal, such as wrong redirect URIs or client secrets.

3. **Scope Issues:**
   - The scopes requested in the authentication request may not match what is permitted for the application.

4. **Invalid or Expired Tokens:**
   - If tokens are being reused, ensure they are current and valid.

5. **Invalid Tenant:**
   - The request may be sent to the wrong Azure tenant or an unsupported tenant.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Inspect the Request:**
   - Use tools like Postman or browser developer tools to capture and inspect the network requests related to the authentication. Look for any abnormalities in the request.

2. **Update Application Configuration:**
   - Go to the Azure portal:
     - Verify the application is properly registered.
     - Ensure all redirect URIs are correctly set.
     - Generate a new client secret if needed.

3. **Validate Parameters:**
   - Cross-check all parameters in the authentication request. Make adjustments to ensure all mandatory fields are present, and confirm they have the correct values.

4. **Test with Different Scopes:**
   - If specific scopes are causing the issue, try using different or fewer scopes to see if the authentication succeeds.

5. **Use the Correct Endpoint:**
   - Ensure that you are using the appropriate Azure AD endpoint. For example:
     - For user sign-in: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize`
     - For access tokens: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token`

6. **Check for CORS Policies:**
   - If it's a web application, ensure that your app is allowed by CORS policies to perform authentication.

7. **Consult Azure Portal Logs:**
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to "Azure Active Directory" > "Sign-ins" to see logs associated with failed sign-ins which might give you clues.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Make sure the Azure AD instance is not experiencing any service outages. Check Azure Service Health for related incidents.
- Ensure that any intermediate proxies or firewalls are not modifying the authentication request.
- If you've recently made changes to your application, allow some time for the settings to propagate.

#### Advice for Data Collection

- **Event Viewer Logs**: 
  - Check the logs in the Windows Event Viewer under the Application section to determine if any related issues are logged.
  
- **NetTrace and Fiddler**:
  - Use Fiddler to capture the HTTP requests and responses while replicating the error. Look closely at the request to see if any parameters are missing or malformed.
  - Use .NET tracing (if applicable) to log details that may not be visible in standard logs, enabling insights into the request process.

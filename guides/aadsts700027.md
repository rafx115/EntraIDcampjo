# AADSTS700027: Client assertion failed signature validation. Developer error - the app is attempting to sign in without the necessary or correct authentication parameters.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS700027

The error code AADSTS700027 indicates that there is an issue with the client assertion's signature validation, typically related to OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect authentication. This can occur in scenarios such as using Azure Active Directory (AAD) for authentication in applications. Below is a detailed guide to diagnose and resolve this issue.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Verify the Application Registration**:
   - Check that the app is correctly registered in Azure AD.
   - Ensure that the **client ID** and **client secret** are correct.

2. **Inspect Authentication Parameters**:
   - Confirm that the authentication parameters being sent with the request are complete and formatted correctly.
   - Look specifically at the `assertion`, which usually is a JWT (JSON Web Token).

3. **Check Logs**:
   - If available, examine any logs in the application to see what values are being sent during authentication.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **Incorrect Signing Key**:
   - Ensure that the signing key used to create the client assertion matches one of the keys configured in Azure AD.

2. **Token Expiration**:
   - Verify that the token (if one is being used) has not expired.

3. **Misconfigured Application**:
   - Check if the application is configured to use the correct authentication flow.
   - Ensure that permissions (scopes) are correctly set up.

4. **Invalid Claims**:
   - Validate the claims in the JWT to ensure they are valid and meet the requirements of Azure AD.

5. **Clock Skew**:
   - Be aware of potential clock skew between the server generating the token and Azure AD. Tokens have an expiration timestamp that must be accurate.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Re-validate the Client Assertion**:
   - Double-check the client assertion payload for correctness.
   - Use tools like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to decode and verify the token structure.

2. **Retrieve Valid Signing Keys**:
   - Go to the Azure portal, navigate to your app registration under **Certificates & Secrets**, and ensure you are using the correct keys.
   - If using a certificate, ensure that it is installed correctly and accessible.

3. **Inspect API Permissions**:
   - In Azure portal, ensure that API permissions are granted and reflect the necessary scopes for your application.

4. **Use Fiddler or Other Proxy Tool**:
   - If you are making requests from a development environment, capture the outgoing requests using Fiddler to verify the parameters being sent.
   - Check particularly for the format and content of the assertions.

5. **Review App Registration Authentication Settings**:
   - Navigate to **Authentication** under your app registration and confirm that the redirect URIs and implicit flow settings are correctly configured.

6. **Conduct a Test Token Generation**:
   - Use a test tool (like Postman) to manually generate a token and see if the error persists.

7. **Make Sure Clock Sync**:
   - Ensure that your server's clock is synchronized with an NTP server to avoid clock skew issues.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Ensure that any middleware or libraries used to authenticate are updated to the latest version, as older versions may have bugs that could cause issues with AAD integrations.
- Review the application code to confirm that the request/response flow adheres to the required specifications for AAD authentication.

- [Azure Active Directory App Registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)

#### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Check the Event Viewer on the server running the application, especially the Application and System logs for any relevant errors or warnings.

2. **Network Tracing**:
   - Collect network traces using tools like Nettrace to capture the network traffic during the authentication process for review.
   - Review the contents of the request and response to identify discrepancies.

3. **Fiddler Capture**:
   - If using Fiddler, capture both the request and response of the authentication flow to inspect headers and body content for potential mismatches.
  
By following these steps systematically, you should be able to identify the root cause of the AADSTS700027 error and implement the necessary resolutions.

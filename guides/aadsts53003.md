# AADSTS53003: BlockedByConditionalAccess - Access has been blocked by Conditional Access policies. The access policy does not allow token issuance. If this is unexpected, see the Conditional Access policy that applied to this request or contact your administrator. For additional information, please visittroubleshooting sign-in with Conditional Access.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Below is a comprehensive troubleshooting guide for the AADSTS53003 error code that you are encountering, specifically regarding Conditional Access policies in Azure Active Directory.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS53003: BlockedByConditionalAccess

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check for Proper Conditions**: Confirm whether the user meets the necessary conditions outlined in the Conditional Access policy:
   - Does the user account have the correct licenses assigned?
   - Is the user account enabled?
   - Is their MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) status appropriate?

2. **Identify the User Role**: Determine if the affected user is an admin or regular user, as Conditional Access policies may differ based on roles.

3. **Review User Context**: Identify under which circumstances the error occurs (e.g., specific locations, network conditions, devices).

4. **Attempt Sign-In with Other Accounts**: Verify if other users encounter the same issue, which could help isolate the problem to either the account or the policy itself.

#### Common Issues that Cause AADSTS53003

1. **Conditional Access Policies**: The user is trying to access a resource governed by a Conditional Access policy that blocks their access.

2. **User Location**: The access being blocked may be due to the user's location not meeting the requirements of the Conditional Access policy (e.g., accessing from an untrusted network).

3. **Device Compliance**: The accessing device might not meet the compliance requirements set in Conditional Access policies (e.g., not being enrolled in Intune).

4. **Application-Specific Restrictions**: Some applications may have more restrictive Conditional Access policies that deny access altogether.

5. **Insufficient Multi-Factor Authentication**: Policies may require additional verification, such as MFA, which the user may not have completed successfully.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Review Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Go to the Azure Portal.
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Conditional Access**.
   - Review the policies that are applied to the user or group to which the user belongs.

2. **Check User’s Group Membership**:
   - Ensure the user is a member of any groups that might be affected by the policy.
   - Modify group memberships if needed to align with intended access.

3. **Examine User Location and Device Compliance**:
   - Confirm if the user’s IP address or geographical location is allowed under Conditional Access.
   - Check if the user’s device is compliant with the organization’s policies.

4. **Review Sign-In Logs**:
   - Check Azure AD Sign-In logs:
     - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Sign-ins**.
     - Filter by the user and review the logs for additional error information.

5. **Testing Access**:
   - Try accessing the application using a different device or network to determine if the issue is related to the original context.

6. **Engage the Administrator**:
   - If unable to resolve, contact your IT administrator to inform them of the issue and possibly to gain further insights into the Conditional Access policy applied.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Conditional Access policies can be complex; thus, thorough understanding is required.
- Be cautious while modifying policies, as changes can affect a broader user base.
- Always adhere to your organization's security policies and guidelines when attempting resolutions.

#### Documentation for Guidance
- Microsoft Documentation on Conditional Access: [Azure AD Conditional Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/)

#### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - For Windows applications, use Event Viewer to check for any specific application errors or logs under **Applications** or **Security** logs.

2. **NetTrace**: 
   - Use tools such as Wireshark or Microsoft Message Analyzer to capture and analyze network traffic if issues are related to network conditions.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Fiddler can help inspect HTTP/HTTPS traffic for requests and responses, allowing you to verify headers or tokens, as Conditional Access evaluations could be based on these.

4. **Gather Information**: Collect user information such as:
   - User agent string.
   - Timestamp of errors.
   - Any specific error messages displayed during the failed sign-in attempt.

By following these structured steps, you should be able to effectively identify and resolve the AADSTS53003 error related to Conditional Access policies. If issues persist, consider reaching out to Microsoft support for more specialized assistance.

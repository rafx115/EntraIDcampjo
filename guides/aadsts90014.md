### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify the Context of the Error:**
   - Determine where the error is occurring (e.g., during user login, token acquisition, etc.).
   - Note the specific operation being attempted when the error occurred.

2. **Collect Error Details:**
   - Gather any relevant error messages, timestamps, and the affected user(s).
   - Check if the error is reproducible or sporadic.

3. **Review Application Logs:**
   - If you have access to application logs, check for any preceding error messages that might indicate what is missing.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Missing Required Authentication Fields:**
   - Some fields, such as `username`, `password`, `client_id`, or others might be missing from the authentication request.

2. **Improperly Configured Application Registration:**
   - The application might not be configured correctly in Azure AD, leading to missing fields.

3. **Misconfigured Authentication Requests:**
   - The request body for authentication might be incorrectly formatted or omitting required parameters.

4. **User Object Issues:**
   - The user account being authenticated might not be properly set up in Azure AD or may have missing attributes.

5. **API Permissions Errors:**
   - Insufficient permissions granted to the application in Azure AD, which can lead to requests failing to authenticate correctly.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Inspect the Authentication Request:**
   - Review the request payload that is being sent for authentication.
   - Ensure that all required fields are included. For user login, required fields might include:
     - `username`
     - `password`
     - `client_id`
     - `tenant_id` (if applicable)

2. **Check Application Registration in Azure Portal:**
   - Go to Azure Active Directory > App registrations.
   - Select your application and confirm that:
     - Application ID (Client ID) and other values are correct.
     - Necessary API permissions are granted and consented.

3. **Review Authentication Code:**
   - If you are using OAuth2/OpenID Connect or another protocol, ensure that you are implementing the authentication flow correctly.
   - Verify that all fields required by the particular flow are populated.

4. **Consult Azure AD Logs:**
   - Access Azure AD > Sign-in logs to see if there are more detailed errors logged for your attempts.

5. **Test the Application with Another User:**
   - Try authenticating with a different user to determine if the issue is user-specific.

6. **Enable Detailed Logging/Tracing:**
   - Depending on your application platform (e.g., ASP.NET, Java), enable detailed logging to capture more information about the request/response.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Ensure your application is using the latest version of any SDKs or libraries required for Azure AD integrations.
- Double-check network configurations or firewalls that may affect communication with Azure AD.
- Consider discussing the issue with your Azure administrator or reviewing related Azure audit logs to gather context around the errors.

### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - If you're applying this in a Windows environment, look for relevant application logs under Windows Event Viewer. Filter for application events and search for any related errors.

2. **Network Tracing:**
   - Use `netsh trace` commands to record a network tracing session if you suspect network issues are influencing the connectivity.

3. **Fiddler:**
   - Install Fiddler and run it while replicating the error. Ensure that the Fiddler root certificate is trusted if working with HTTPS traffic.
   - Analyze the request and response to check for missing parameters or fields.

These steps will assist you in diagnosing and resolving the AADSTS90014 error effectively. Good luck!

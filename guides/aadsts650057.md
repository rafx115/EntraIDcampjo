# AADSTS650057: Invalid resource. The client has requested access to a resource which isn't listed in the requested permissions in the client's application registration. Client app ID: {appId}({appName}). Resource value from request: {resource}. Resource app ID: {resourceAppId}. List of valid resources from app registration: {regList}.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The error code AADSTS650057 indicates that the client application is attempting to access a resource that is not permitted by its application registration in Azure Active Directory (AAD). Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide based on the components you've requested.

### Detailed Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS650057

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Verify the Error Message**: Read the error message carefully to confirm the `resource` and the corresponding `resourceAppId`. This will help you understand what resource the application is trying to access.
   
2. **Identify the Client Application**: Take note of the Client App ID (`appId`) and Application Name (`appName`) from the error message.

3. **Check User Permissions**: Ensure that the user encountering the error has the necessary permissions to use the application and access the requested resource.

#### Common Issues that Cause this Error
- The application registration does not include the requested resource in its API permissions.
- The application requests permissions that have not been granted by an administrator.
- The resource being requested is incorrect (i.e., a typo or outdated resource).
- The application has not been granted consent for the permissions in a multi-tenant scenario.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Verify Application Registration**:
   - Go to the Azure Portal.
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations**.
   - Search for the application using the Client App ID or Name.

2. **Check API Permissions**:
   - Under the selected app registration, go to **API permissions**.
   - Review the list of permissions granted to the application. Ensure that the required API (defined by `resourceAppId`) is present and listed.

3. **Add Missing Permissions**:
   - If the required resource is not listed:
     - Click **Add a permission**.
     - Select the API that your application needs to access.
     - Choose the required permissions (delegated or application permissions).
     - Click **Add permissions**.

4. **Grant Admin Consent** (if applicable):
   - If the application needs permissions that require admin consent, ensure that consent is granted.
   - You may find the option to "Grant admin consent for {YourOrganization}" under the API permissions section.

5. **Testing**:
   - After updating permissions, conduct a test by attempting to access the resource again.
   - Ensure that the application is using the correct resource URI as defined in the permissions.

6. **Review Application Code**:
   - Ensure that the correct resource URI is being used in the application code that requests the token. This should match the resource you added in the Azure Portal.

7. **Consult Documentation**: Refer to Microsoft's documentation for further details on the permissions model and how to configure application registrations. This can help clarify specifics you might need to consider.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Keep in mind that some permissions may require more than just adding them. Consider the role of the user(s) interacting with the application.
- Make sure you've followed best practices regarding privileges and scopes to maintain security.

#### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**:
  - Capture logs related to application authentication failures. Look for entries under `Windows Logs` > `Application` or `Security`.
  
- **Network Traces**:
  - Use `Nettrace` or `Fiddler` to capture the outbound requests from the application to Azure AD. This may help identify if the correct URLs are being hit and if any specific details about the requests are incorrect.

- **Error Details**:
  - Collect information from any relevant error messages in the response, as they may provide additional context on the failure.

## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide for the error code AADSTS50126, which indicates issues with validating user credentials due to invalid username or password. 

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50126

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify User Feedback**: Determine if the affected user(s) are experiencing problems during sign-in and note what they report.
2. **Reproduce the Error**: Try to sign in with the same credentials to see if the issue can be replicated.
3. **Check for Recent Changes**: Investigate if there have been any recent changes in the user’s account, such as password changes, disabled accounts, or external security settings.
4. **Verify Connection and Access**: Ensure the user has a stable internet connection and is accessing the correct login portal.

#### Common Issues that Cause this Error
- **Incorrect Credentials**: The user may have entered an incorrect username or password.
- **Account Lockout**: Multiple failed sign-in attempts could lead to temporary account lockout due to security policies.
- **Domain Issues**: Issues with the user’s domain, such as domain sync failures, could lead to obstacles in credential validation.
- **User Account Configurations**: The user account might be disabled or not properly configured in Azure AD.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: The user may not complete the MFA challenge correctly if it is enabled.
- **Credential Caching**: The user's credentials may be cached incorrectly in their local client.
- **Timeout or Connectivity Issues**: Network issues preventing the client from reaching the authentication service.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Retrain Users on Password Management**:
   - Ensure users are aware of the correct user ID and password format.
   - Encourage password security practices, such as using password managers.

2. **Check Account Status**:
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to Azure Active Directory > Users.
   - Verify that the account is active and not locked out or disabled. 

3. **Reset User Password**:
   - If the user has forgotten their password, guide them through the process of resetting it using self-service password reset options or have an administrator reset the password.

4. **Enable and Review Sign-in Logs**:
   - Go to Azure Active Directory > Sign-ins and review logs for failed sign-in attempts.
   - Check if there are patterns or common errors indicating a deeper issue.

5. **Test with Different Devices or Browsers**:
   - Suggest users attempt to sign in from a different browser or device to rule out browser extensions or local client issues.

6. **Review MFA or Conditional Access Policies**:
   - If MFA is enabled, ensure the user receives and completes the MFA prompt correctly.
   - Investigate if any conditional access policies might be affecting sign in.

7. **Use Microsoft Support Tools**:
   - For organizations, consider using Microsoft Support tools to run diagnostics on user accounts.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **User Education**: Inform users about common authentication issues and encourage them to double-check their login details before seeking help.
- **Security Policies**: Businesses may have security policies that automatically lock accounts after multiple failed attempts; understanding these is crucial for preventing lockouts.
- **Documentation**: Keep updated documentation for all users regarding procedures for resetting passwords and troubleshooting sign-in issues.

#### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**: Instruct users/administrators to check logs on client systems (Windows Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Application) for signs of authentication failures.
- **Network Traces**: Use network tracing tools like `nettrace` to capture network packets; ensure sensitive data privacy during this process.
- **Fiddler**: If the issue persists with web applications, use Fiddler to analyze HTTP requests and responses; look for error codes in responses that may provide additional insights.

# AADSTS1000002: BindCompleteInterruptError - The bind completed successfully, but the user must be informed.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS1000002

#### Description
The error code **AADSTS1000002** refers to a **BindCompleteInterruptError**, indicating that a bind operation completed successfully, but there are associated user actions required post-completion. This error can be associated with Azure Active Directory (AAD) integration and has implications for user authentication processes.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Review the Context of the Error**: 
   - Determine when and how this error occurs (e.g., during sign-ins, API calls, etc.).
   - Collect information about the user or service principal involved. 

2. **Check User Input**:
   - Ensure that the user has provided the correct input credentials.
   - Validate any prompts the user might be seeing that might require action.

3. **Examine Application Logs**: 
   - Look at application logs for any detailed error messages that might give insight into what is expected from the user.

4. **Gather User Feedback**:
   - Ask the affected user if they noticed any additional prompts or messages that might link to this bind operation.

### Common Issues that Cause this Error
1. **Missing User Action**: The user may need to accept permissions, complete a multi-factor authentication (MFA) challenge, or respond to prompts indicating additional actions.
  
2. **Conditional Access Policies**: If there are conditional access policies in place, they may require additional steps based on the user's environment (e.g., location, device compliance).

3. **Session Expiration**: Sometimes, user sessions may expire midway through a sensitive operation, requiring them to re-establish their session or relog.

4. **Ineffective Application Configuration**: The application may not adequately handle the user flows or consent requirements.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Prompt User Actions**:
   - If the error indicates a requirement for user action (e.g., MFA, consent), guide the user to complete these steps.
   - Provide instructions on how to complete the necessary actions.

2. **Review Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Ensure that any policies that might require user action are clearly communicated to the users.
   - Modify policies if necessary after consultation with security and compliance teammates.

3. **Reconfigure Application Permissions**:
   - If permissions were not granted, review the application settings in the Azure portal to ensure necessary permissions are granted.
   - If users need to consent to permissions, batch process these requests for user ease where applicable.

4. **Check User State**: 
   - Verify that the user is not locked out or disabled in Azure AD.
   - Check if the user's device meets the identity requirements (e.g., is registered and compliant).

5. **Session Management**:
   - If the session could be a problem, ask the user to log out and log back in or try to refresh their session.

6. **Contact Support**: 
   - If the issue persists after all troubleshooting steps, contact Azure support with all relevant logs and telemetry.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Regularly verify that all applications using Azure AD for authentication are properly configured and up to date.
- Consider performing a periodic review of user permissions and conditional access policies to ensure they align with current security practices.

### Advice for Data Collection
1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Capture relevant logs from Windows Event Viewer related to the authentication process.
   - Filter logs for errors or warnings related to Azure AD or user authentication.

2. **NetTrace**:
   - Use network tracing tools to capture network traffic during the authentication process. Tools like Wireshark can be helpful here. 
   - Ensure sensitive information is not exposed.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Set up Fiddler to log HTTP traffic, especially during the authentication flows to view any requests that fail or take too long.
   - Look out for failed requests that could provide clues related to the bind operation.

By following this guide, you should be able to effectively troubleshoot and resolve the AADSTS1000002 error while also helping users through any necessary actions.

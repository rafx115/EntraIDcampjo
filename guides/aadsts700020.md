# AADSTS700020: InteractionRequired - The access grant requires interaction.


## Troubleshooting Steps
**Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS700020 (InteractionRequired)**

### Description:
The error code AADSTS700020 indicates that user interaction is required to complete the authentication process. This often occurs when a user needs to consent to permissions, multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required, or there are security policies in place that necessitate some form of user action.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Check the Context**:
   - Identify when the error occurs (e.g., during sign-in, after token refresh, etc.).
   - Determine the user account experiencing the issue and the app they are attempting to access.

2. **Review Authentication Flow**:
   - Consider whether the user is signing in for the first time or if any changes were made to permissions or application registration.

3. **Inspect Policies and Configuration**:
   - Check for any conditional access policies or MFA requirements that might affect the sign-in process.

### Common Issues that Cause This Error:
1. **Consent Required**:
   - The application permissions require user consent that has not been granted.

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - MFA is enforced for the user, but the user has not completed the MFA challenge.

3. **Revoked Grants**:
   - The user's tokens may have been revoked, or the application may have lost permission to access resources.

4. **Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Security policies may require further interaction (e.g., sign-in from a compliant device).

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Check User Permissions**:
   - Ensure that the application has the necessary permissions granted by the user. 
   - If the app requires admin consent, ensure that the admin has granted it.

2. **Check and Complete MFA**:
   - If MFA is required, ensure that the user has set up MFA correctly. Ask them to sign in and complete any MFA prompts.
   - Verify if there are any recent changes in MFA configurations that might impact the userâ€™s ability to authenticate.

3. **Revoke and Reissue Tokens**:
   - Advise the user to sign out and then sign back in to refresh their authentication tokens.
   - If a token revocation occurred, ensure the user is attempting to re-authenticate.

4. **Conditional Access and Access Policies**:
   - Review and adjust any Conditional Access policies relevant to the user to allow sign-ins.
   - This may include ensuring the user is using a compliant device or proper application context.

5. **Notify User for Interaction**:
   - If the application is designed to trigger user interaction, ensure the user is aware of this and guide them through the necessary steps.

### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- Encourage users to clear their browser cache and cookies if using web apps, as machine or session artifacts might cause issues.
- If using a mobile or desktop application, check for any application updates that might resolve incompatibility.

### Documentation for Guidance:
- **Microsoft Docs on Azure AD Error Codes**: [AADSTS Error Codes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aad-error-codes)
- **Understanding Conditional Access Policies**: [Conditional Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview)
- **Multi-Factor Authentication Setup**: [Set up MFA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/user-help/multi-factor-authentication-end-user-requirements)

### Advice for Data Collection:
If issues persist, collect and analyze logs to understand the requests and responses involved:

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Use Windows Event Viewer to check for authentication-related events.

2. **Network Tracing (NetTrace)**:
   - Use `netsh trace start` and `netsh trace stop` to capture network traffic and analyze HTTP requests/responses.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Use Fiddler to capture HTTP requests and responses. Look for errors in the response headers or body related to authentication.

This data can provide further insight into where the process is failing and what user interactions, if any, need to be addressed for successful authentication.

## Troubleshooting Steps

Here is a detailed troubleshooting guide for the error code AADSTS700020 with
the description "InteractionRequired - The access grant requires interaction":

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:** 

1. **Check User Interaction**: Ensure that the user attempting to access the
   resource is provided with the required interactive prompt to grant
   permissions.
2. **Verify Configuration**: Review the Azure AD application registration
   settings, authentication flows, and permissions granted to identify any
   misconfigurations.

**Common Issues That Cause This Error:** 

1. **Missing Consent**: Users or administrators have not provided consent for
   the application to access their data. This can occur when the application is
   requesting permissions that require admin consent.

2. **Incorrect Authentication Flow**: The application might not be configured to
   handle interactive sign-ins properly, leading to the need for interaction.

3. **Token Request Configuration**: The token request may not include the
   necessary parameters or scopes required for interactive sign-ins.

**Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:** 

1. **Request User Consent**: Have the user sign in again to trigger the consent
   prompt if the application requires additional permissions. This will enable
   the user to grant the necessary permissions.

2. **Update Application Configuration**:
   * Check the application registration in Azure AD and ensure that the correct

     permissions are requested.
   * Verify that the authentication flow is set up to handle interactive

     sign-ins.

3. **Adjust Token Request**:
   * Ensure that the token request sent by the application includes the required

     parameters for interactive sign-ins.
   * Check the scopes requested in the token request to ensure they align with

     the permissions needed.

**Additional Notes or Considerations:**


* Review the Azure AD logs and monitoring to gather more information on the

  specific requests that triggered the error.

* If the error persists, you may need to involve your Azure AD administrator to

  troubleshoot further and provide necessary permissions.

By following these steps and considering the common issues, you should be able
to troubleshoot and resolve the AADSTS700020 error related to interaction
requirements effectively.

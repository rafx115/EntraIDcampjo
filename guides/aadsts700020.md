#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Confirm the Error Code**: Ensure that the error code is indeed AADSTS700020. This will help in accurate troubleshooting.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- **Logging**: Use logging mechanisms to track the flow and identify where the error occurs.
  
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to give clear messages to users if similar errors occur in the future.

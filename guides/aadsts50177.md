# AADSTS50177: ExternalChallengeNotSupportedForPassthroughUsers - External challenge isn't supported for passthrough users.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide for the error code AADSTS50177: "ExternalChallengeNotSupportedForPassthroughUsers - External challenge isn't supported for passthrough users." 

### Detailed Troubleshooting Guide

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Understand Passthrough Authentication**: Ensure you understand that passthrough authentication allows for non-intrusive authentication processes, often with no user password changes needed. Identify if the user is indeed configured for passthrough authentication.
  
2. **Review the User's Authentication Method**: Check if the user encountering the error is configured to use passthrough authentication and if they should be. If the user is an external user, this feature would typically not apply.

3. **Check User Profile**: Verify the user's directory information in Azure Active Directory (AAD). Confirm their sign-in methods and authentication flows.

4. **Identify External User Type**: Determine if the user is an external guest user and clarify if they should be subject to the specific authentication challenges typically designed for internal users.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **Misconfigured User Attributes**: The user may have been misconfigured to use passthrough authentication incorrectly, especially if they belong to an external directory domain.

2. **Guest Account Permissions**: External users usually cannot use passthrough authentication as they may not possess the necessary permissions or configurations associated with internal users.

3. **Authentication Policy**: There may be an authentication policy that is conflicting with the passthrough user settings, leading to this error.

4. **Conditional Access Policies**: Some applied policies might restrict the authentication challenges for external users or guests.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Verify User Configuration**:
   - Go to the Azure Active Directory portal.
   - Navigate to Users → [specific user].
   - Ensure their authentication method is consistent with being a passthrough user and check external user attributes.

2. **Adjust Authentication Methods**:
   - If the user should not be a passthrough user, adjust their sign-in configuration to a more suitable method (e.g., enable alternative multi-factor authentication if necessary).

3. **Review Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Check any configured Conditional Access Policies.
   - Ensure there are no settings that restrict passthrough users from obtaining an appropriate external authentication challenge. 

4. **Test with Different Accounts**:
   - If possible, test accessing the service with different accounts that are configured as either passthrough or standard users to see if the error persists.

5. **Azure AD Settings Review**:
   - Review your Azure AD configuration settings related to authentication methods, making sure guest users are set up correctly.
   - Confirm settings in "User settings" and "External collaboration settings."

6. **Contact Microsoft Support**:
   - If all else fails, it may be beneficial to reach out to Microsoft Support for insights specific to your tenant configuration.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Remember that passthrough authentication is typically used for internal users and may not be applicable or supported for all external or guest users.
- Always ensure that external users are using an authentication method that is compliant with your organizational policy.

#### Documentation for Guidance
- Azure Active Directory Documentation: [Manage authentication methods in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-methods)
- Conditional Access Policies: [Conditional access in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview)
- Azure Active Directory User Management: [Manage users in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/user-management/user-management-introduction)

#### Advice for Data Collection
- When troubleshooting, it may be helpful to collect diagnostic logs:
  - **Event Viewer Logs**: Check the Event Viewer on the authentication servers for any relevant logs regarding authentication failures.
  - **Network Trace**: Use NetTrace or Fiddler to capture network requests and responses, specifically around the time when the issue occurred.
  - **Azure AD Sign-in Logs**: Use the Azure AD sign-in logs to identify patterns around the login attempts that failed.

By methodically following the steps and considering the common issues described, you should be able to resolve or better understand the AADSTS50177 error.

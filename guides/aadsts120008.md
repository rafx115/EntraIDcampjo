# AADSTS120008: PasswordChangeAsyncJobStateTerminated - A non-retryable error has occurred.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Error code AADSTS120008, with the description "PasswordChangeAsyncJobStateTerminated - A non-retryable error has occurred,” usually indicates an issue encountered while processing a password change request in Azure Active Directory (AAD). Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide to help resolve this issue.

### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps
- **Check the User Context**: Identify which user is experiencing this error. Determine if it occurs for all users or a specific user.
- **Review Error Message Details**: Look for additional error details or a correlation ID that can help in tracing the error.
- **Check Azure AD Status**: Visit the Azure status page to see if there are any service outages or incidents that could affect Azure AD.

### 2. Common Issues that Cause this Error
- **Account Lockout**: The user’s account might be locked due to multiple unsuccessful login attempts.
- **Password Policy Violations**: The new password might not meet the organization’s password complexity requirements.
- **User Account Issues**: The user account could be in a state that doesn’t allow password changes (e.g., disabled or deleted).
- **Licensing Restrictions**: Certain licensing tiers might have restrictions on password changes.
- **External Auth Providers**: Issues with federated identities or external authentication providers can also cause interruptions.

### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
#### Step 1: Verify User Account Status
- Check if the user account is active, valid, and not locked.
- Use the Azure portal: 
  - Navigate to Azure Active Directory > Users > [Choose User].
  - Verify the sign-in status.
  
#### Step 2: Review Password Policy Compliance
- Ensure that the new password meets the organization’s password policy.
- In the Azure portal, navigate to Azure Active Directory > Users > "User settings">
  - Review password policies under "Password reset".

#### Step 3: Check Account Locks and Sign-in Activity
- Check if the account is locked due to too many failed sign-in attempts.
- You can view sign-in logs in the Azure portal:
  - Navigate to Azure Active Directory > Sign-ins.
  - Filter for the user and check logs for any failed sign-ins related to password change attempts.

#### Step 4: Use PowerShell for Diagnostics
If necessary, use PowerShell to gather more insights:
```powershell
Get-AzureADUser -ObjectId <UserEmail>
Get-AzureADUser -ObjectId <UserEmail> | Select-Object AccountEnabled, PasswordPolicies
```

#### Step 5: Review Application and Service Configurations
- If using federated authentication (e.g., ADFS), check the server configurations and event logs.
- Review ADFS service reliability (if applicable) for any interruptions during password change requests.

#### Step 6: Contact Microsoft Support
If the issue persists after troubleshooting, consider contacting Microsoft support with the details and error logs collected.

### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations
- Be cautious with making changes to password policies, as it may impact all users.
- Ensure to follow the organization’s change management policies when modifying any configurations.

### 5. Documentation Resources
- Azure Active Directory Documentation: [Azure AD Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/)
- Troubleshooting for Azure Active Directory sign-in issues: [Troubleshoot Azure AD sign-in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/tshoot-sign-in)

### 6. Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**: If troubleshooting on a local machine, check the Event Viewer for errors cataloged under “Application” and “Security”.
- **Network Traces**: Use tools such as `nettrace` to capture network requests during the password change attempt.
  ```powershell
  netsh trace start capture=yes
  ```
- **Fiddler**: Use Fiddler to inspect outgoing requests and responses to diagnose issues related to API calls, especially if you have custom applications interfacing with Azure AD.

By following this comprehensive troubleshooting guide, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the AADSTS120008 error effectively.

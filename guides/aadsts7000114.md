# AADSTS7000114: Application 'appIdentifier' isn't allowed to make application on-behalf-of calls.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS7000114 Error

The error code AADSTS7000114 indicates that the application identified by `appIdentifier` is not permitted to perform on-behalf-of (OBO) calls. This typically occurs when using the OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect protocols with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify the Application**: Determine the application that is throwing the error and verify its application (client) ID.
2. **Check the Permissions**: Review the permissions and scopes assigned to this application in the Azure portal.
3. **Review the Token Request**: Analyze the request payload being sent to the Azure AD token endpoint to ensure it is correctly formatted and includes all necessary parameters (like `scope`, `grant_type`, etc.).

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error
1. **Insufficient Permissions**: The application might lack the required permissions to make OBO calls.
2. **Incorrect Token Flow**: The application might not be using the correct OAuth flow for the action intended.
3. **Admin Consent Missing**: Required admin consent for certain API permissions has not been granted.
4. **Incorrect Configuration**: Incorrect settings in Azure AD application registration related to OBO or the API it’s trying to access.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify Application Registration**:
   - Go to Azure Active Directory in the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to “App registrations”.
   - Locate and select the application associated with `appIdentifier`.

2. **Check API Permissions**:
   - Under “API permissions”, ensure that the correct permissions are granted for the service you are trying to call.
   - If using Microsoft Graph or any other API, ensure OBO permissions (for example, `User.Read.All` for Microsoft Graph) are listed.
   - If you’ve added new permissions, make sure to click on “Grant admin consent for [Your Organization]”.

3. **Check Application Roles**:
   - Confirm if the API that the application interacts with has defined application roles and whether the app should be assigned to one of these roles.
   
4. **Validate the OBO Setup**:
   - Ensure that the correct `scope` is being requested in your token request, using the 'api://{API-application-id}/.default' pattern if accessing another API.
   - Use the `assertion` parameter correctly with the token from the resource owner.

5. **Review Documentation**:
   - Review Microsoft's documentation on [On-Behalf-Of flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth-on-behalf-of) for any specific compliance or configuration settings.
   - Ensure that you are familiar with Microsoft’s OAuth2 and OpenID Connect policies.

6. **Testing and Logging**:
   - Use tools like Fiddler or browser developer tools to inspect the requests and responses between the application and Azure AD. Look for errors in the HTTP response which might provide deeper insights.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Make sure the application is accessible and has not been disabled or removed from your Azure AD.
- Validate that you are using the correct host and endpoint for token acquisition.
- If working in multiple environments (test, staging, production), ensure that the correct application configuration is being used.

#### Advice for Data Collection
When diagnosing the AADSTS7000114 issue, consider collecting the following data:
- **Event Logs**: Check the event viewer for any application-specific logs or Azure AD logs that may highlight issues related to authentication.
- **Network Traces**: Use **Fiddler** or **Microsoft Network Trace (nettrace)** to capture request flows. Look for:
  - HTTP status codes in response.
  - Token requests/responses, especially the presence of the `error` field.
- **Debugging Tools**: Utilize any built-in logging provided by the application framework to track authentication flows and error messages.

By following these steps, you should be effectively able to troubleshoot and resolve the AADSTS7000114 error in your application.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS120003 Error

**Error Code: AADSTS120003**

**Description: PasswordChangeInvalidNewPasswordContainsMemberName**

This error occurs when a user attempts to change their password to one that includes their account name or member name, which is not allowed due to security policies in place to prevent the use of easily guessable passwords.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps:

1. **Identify the User Account:**
   - Verify the account name or user ID of the individual encountering the error.
   
2. **Review User Inputs:**
   - Confirm the user is aware of their current password and is changing it through the appropriate interface.

3. **Check for Recent Changes:**
   - Assess if the user has recently had their account or password policies updated.

4. **Collect Context:**
   - Note the platform or application the user was using when experiencing the error (e.g., web browser, mobile app, etc.).

---

### Common Issues that Cause this Error:

1. **New Password Contains Username:**
   - The user has entered a new password that includes parts of their username or member name.

2. **Password Complexity Requirements:**
   - Misunderstanding of the complexity requirements regarding special characters and prohibited words, which may include portions of the username.

3. **Cached Credentials:**
   - Cached credentials in the application or device being used may affect the password change process.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **Instruct User on Valid Password Creation:**
   - Advise the user to create a new password that:
     - Does **not** contain their username or any part of their member name.
     - Meets the complexity requirements (e.g., length, character variety).

2. **Guidance on Password Creation:**
   - Suggest using a mix of:
     - Uppercase and lowercase letters.
     - Numbers.
     - Special characters (excluding personal identifiers).

3. **Clear Cached Credentials:**
   - If applicable, instruct the user to clear their cached credentials:
     - **Windows:** Go to Control Panel -> Credential Manager -> Windows Credentials and remove any stored credentials related to Azure.
     - **Web Browsers:** Clear autofill and stored passwords in the browser settings.

4. **Attempt Password Reset Again:**
   - Have the user try the password reset again with a valid password that fulfills the criteria.

5. **Testing Other Accounts:**
   - If possible, check if other users can change their passwords successfully to rule out account-specific issues.

---

### Additional Notes or Considerations:

- Security policies are often organization-specific; ensure the user is aware of any internal password policies that may be in force.
- Educate users on using password managers to create and store complex passwords.

### Documentation for Guidance:

1. **Microsoft Identity Documentation:**
   - [Azure AD Password Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-passwords)
   - [Resetting a userâ€™s password](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/user-help/user-help-password-reset)

2. **Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords:**
   - [NIST Password Guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#memorable-words)

### Advice for Data Collection:

1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - Check the Event Viewer on the client machine for any relevant application logs or errors associated with the password change attempt.

2. **Network Tracing:**
   - Use `NetTrace` or `Fiddler` to capture network traffic if you suspect that there could be issues related to the communication with Azure:
     - Set up a capture before reproducing the error and save data for analysis.
     - Look for HTTP status codes or responses that may provide additional context.

3. **Collect Detailed Error Responses:**
   - If available, collect complete error messages returned from API or service calls to identify other potential issues.

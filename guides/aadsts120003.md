## Troubleshooting Steps
Sure, the error code AADSTS120003 with the description "PasswordChangeInvalidNewPasswordContainsMemberName" typically indicates that the new password being set for the user account contains the user's account name or any variant of it, which is against the password policy of Azure Active Directory (AAD).

Here's a detailed troubleshooting guide for resolving this error:

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Confirm the Error Code**: Ensure that the error code being received is indeed AADSTS120003.
2. **Identify User Account**: Determine which user account is attempting to change the password.
3. **Review Password Requirements**: Familiarize yourself with Azure AD's password policies, especially the restrictions that might apply to password composition.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Password Composition**: The new password includes the user's name or a variation (like any part of the email address).
2. **Policy Restrictions**: Unable to meet the organization's password complexity requirements, especially regarding using user-related strings.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify Password Input**: Check the new password input to ensure that it does **not** contain:
   - The user's account name
   - The user's previous passwords
   - Common words or passwords used by the user

2. **Suggest a Valid Password**: Enforce a password that meets the following criteria:
   - At least 8 characters long
   - Contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character
   - Does not contain the user's account name or parts of it

3. **Use Password Generators**: Recommend the use of a password generator tool to create a strong password that is less likely to conflict with Azure AD rules.

4. **Change Password via Different Tools**: If changing the password via one method fails (e.g., web portal), try another method like:
   - PowerShell cmdlets (`Set-MsolUserPassword`, or `Set-AzureADUserPassword`).
   - Azure portal using the admin interface.
   - Email link for self-service password reset.

5. **Update Password Through Admin Portal**: If needed, as an admin, you can change the password directly from the Azure Active Directory admin center.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Ensure that the user understands the password policy and the need for a strong, unique password that does not reference their personal identifiers.
- Review any organizational communications regarding password management or complexity requirements.
- If users are repeatedly having issues with password changes, consider providing guidance or training on secure password practices.

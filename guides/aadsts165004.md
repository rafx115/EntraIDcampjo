### Step 1: Initial Actions

1. Log in to the Azure AD portal.
2. Navigate to the "Users" section.
3. Select the affected user.
4. Perform necessary actions as described for the error.


### Step 2: Verify MFA Settings

## Troubleshooting Steps


### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS165004:


#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:

1. Understand the specific context where the error is occurring (e.g., login,
   authentication process, accessing specific resource/API).
2. Check if the error is consistently reproducible or intermittent.
3. Review any relevant logs or error messages provided by the system (exception
   message) to get more insights into the root cause of the issue.


#### Common Issues:

1. Invalid credentials provided during the authentication process.
2. Misconfiguration in the Azure Active Directory (AAD) setup related to
   permissions, app registration, or user roles.
3. Network connectivity issues affecting the authentication flow.
4. Runtime-specific issues related to the environment where the application is
   running.


#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. Verify Credentials:
   * Ensure that the correct credentials (username/password, client ID, client

     secret, etc.) are provided for authentication.
   * If using multi-factor authentication, complete the additional verification

     steps.

2. Check Azure AD Configuration:

   * Review the Azure AD application registration settings such as required

     permissions, API access, redirect URIs, etc.
   * Check user roles and permissions assigned in Azure AD for the specific user

     encountering the error.

3. Network and Environment Checks:

   * Verify network connectivity to Azure services and endpoints required for

     authentication.
   * Ensure the system or application environment meets the requirements for

     running the authentication process.

4. Analyze Exception Message:

   * Refer to the specific exception message provided with the error code for

     insights into the exact issue.
   * Search for any documented solutions or known issues related to the content

     of the exception message.

5. Update Application Code:
   * If the error is related to a specific runtime, review and update the

     application code to handle runtime-specific exceptions or errors.
   * Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage exceptions

     and provide relevant error messages to users.


#### Additional Notes or Considerations:


* Consult Microsoft Azure documentation, forums, or support resources for

  additional guidance on troubleshooting authentication errors in Azure AD.

* Consider using Azure AD diagnostic logging to capture detailed logs for

  analyzing authentication issues.

* Collaborate with your development team or Azure AD administrators to

  investigate and resolve complex or persistent issues with the AADSTS165004
  error code.

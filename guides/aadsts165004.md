# AADSTS165004: Actual message content is runtime specific. Please see returned exception message for details.


## Troubleshooting Steps
The error code AADSTS165004 is associated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and indicates that there was an issue during the authentication or authorization process. The message indicates that the actual error is runtime specific and may require examining additional exception messages for details. Below is a structured troubleshooting guide to help diagnose and resolve the issue.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS165004

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Verify the Error Context**: Determine where the error is occurring (e.g., during user sign-in, token acquisition, etc.). Gather the context of the action that led to the error.
2. **Check the Application**: Identify the specific application or service that is generating the error. Ensure that you are using the correct application ID and redirect URIs.
3. **Review Exception Messages**: If available, check any exception message details returned alongside the AADSTS165004 code. This often provides more context about the underlying issue.

#### Common Issues that Cause this Error
1. **Invalid Credentials**: The user may have entered incorrect username/password combinations.
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Issues**: If MFA is enforced, issues with the additional verification method can prevent successful authentication.
3. **Token Expiration or Revocation**: The access token may have expired or been revoked.
4. **App Registration Issues**: Misconfigured application registrations in Azure AD, such as incorrect redirect URIs or app secret expiry.
5. **Permissions and Consent**: The user may not have granted appropriate permission, or the app requires permissions not granted.
6. **Conditional Access Policies**: Azure AD Conditional Access rules could be preventing the sign-in based on user/location/device risk.
7. **Service Outages**: Check if there's an ongoing outage in Azure AD services that could affect authentication.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **User Credential Verification**:
   - Confirm that the user's credentials are correct.
   - Attempt signing in with a different account to see if the issue persists.
   
2. **Check User MFA Settings**:
   - Verify if the user has MFA configured and if there are any issues with the verification method (e.g., phone, app).
   
3. **Monitor Token Status**:
   - If using refresh tokens, ensure that they havenâ€™t expired.
   - Look for token issuance and validation logs to troubleshoot potential expiration issues.

4. **Review Azure AD App Registration**:
   - Login to the Azure portal and navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations**.
   - Check the application configuration, focusing on:
     - Redirect URIs.
     - Application secrets and certificates.
     - Permissions under API permissions.

5. **Examine Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Check if Conditional Access policies are in place that may be denying access based on user/device/location.

6. **Check for Service Outages**:
   - Visit the Azure Status page (https://status.azure.com/en-us/status) to see if there are any ongoing service issues with Azure AD.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that the application is properly registered within Azure AD and configured to support your authentication flow (authorization code, implicit, etc.).
- Consider enabling logging for the application to track authentication attempts and responses, which can provide meaningful insights.

#### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**: On the client machine, check the Event Viewer under Windows Logs > Application for errors relevant to the application or authentication process.
- **Network Traces**:
  - Use **NetTrace** to capture network packets during the authentication process. This can help identify issues with communication between the application and Azure AD.
- **Fiddler**:
  - Run **Fiddler** to monitor HTTP requests and responses while reproducing the error. Look for any failed requests that might give additional context about the issue.

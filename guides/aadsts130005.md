### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Review the Error Context:**
   - Confirm when and where the error occurs (e.g., web application, mobile application).
   - Check if the issue affects all users or is isolated to specific accounts.

2. **Check the Device and Environment:**
   - Ensure the device is manageable and compliant with company policies.
   - Verify that the operating system and software are up to date.

3. **Confirm User Credentials:**
   - Ensure the user is entering correct credentials.
   - If Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled, validate that the second factor is properly configured.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Expired or Invalid NGC Key:**
   - The NGC key on the device may have expired or been corrupted.

2. **Re-Enrollment Required:**
   - The user may need to re-enroll the device or reset their credentials.

3. **Incorrect Device Configuration:**
   - If the device has been improperly configured (e.g. wrong Intune settings), the NGC key validation may fail.

4. **Service Outages:**
   - Check for any known service outages affecting Azure AD, as this might temporarily cause authentication issues.

5. **Network Issues:**
   - Connectivity problems might prevent the device from reaching Azure AD services for verification.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Reboot the Device:**
   - This simple step can clear temporary issues and reset network connections.

2. **Clear User Credentials:**
   - For Windows devices:
     - Go to Settings → Accounts → Access work or school.
     - Remove the existing account that is causing issues.
     - Re-add the account and provide the necessary credentials.
   
3. **Check NGC Key Status:**
   - If using Windows Hello, you may need to reset your Windows Hello PIN or recreate your NGC key.
   - Navigate to Settings → Accounts → Sign-in options → Windows Hello PIN, and select "I forgot my PIN" to reset.

4. **Re-establish Connectivity:**
   - Confirm network connectivity is stable.
   - Use a different network if possible to rule out local connectivity issues.

5. **Device Compliance:**
   - Check the compliance policies in Intune or any other MDM/EMM solutions your organization is using.
   - Ensure the device meets all compliance requirements.

6. **Error Logging:**
   - Collect relevant logs for further investigation:
     - Event Viewer (Windows) under Applications and Services Logs → Microsoft → Windows → Hello for Business.
     - Use **nettrace** or **Fiddler** to capture network activity related to the sign-in process.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **User Permissions:**
  - Ensure that the user has the necessary permissions in Azure AD to log in.

- **Account Status:**
  - Verify the user's account status in Azure AD (active, disabled, etc.) and ensure there are no conditional access policies blocking access.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication:**
  - Ensure MFA is correctly configured and working if it is enforced for the user or device.

### Advice for Data Collection

- **Event Viewer Logs:**
  - Look for errors in “Application Logs” and “System Logs” which might point to authentication or device issues.

- **NetTrace:**
  - Use the Command Prompt or PowerShell to collect network traces:
    ```
    netsh trace start capture=yes tracefile=c:\temp\nettrace.etl
    ```
    To stop the trace:
    ```
    netsh trace stop
    ```

- **Fiddler:**
  - Set up Fiddler to capture HTTP/S traffic and look for any failed requests related to AAD during the authentication process.

By following these guidelines and troubleshooting steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the AADSTS130005 error effectively.

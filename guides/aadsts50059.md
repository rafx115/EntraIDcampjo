### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50059 Error

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Identify the Context of the Error**:
   - Determine when and how the error occurs. Is it during a login attempt, API call, or an application access?
   - Check if the error appears for all users or specific ones.

2. **Review User Input**:
   - Ensure that the username or email address being used includes the correct tenant information (e.g., `user@tenant.onmicrosoft.com` or `user@customdomain.com`).

3. **Check Application Configuration**:
   - Verify that your application is properly registered in the Azure portal. Check for correct redirect URIs and the tenant ID in the app registration.

4. **Monitor Network Traffic**:
   - Use tools like Fiddler or browser developer tools to monitor the HTTP requests being sent. Look at the request headers and payload to verify tenant information is included.

#### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **Missing Tenant Information**:
   - The user login does not include tenant identifier information. This could happen if a user tries to log in with only their username without a domain.

2. **Incorrect Application Registration**:
   - The application may not be registered correctly in Azure AD. It might lack necessary permissions or config settings.

3. **Token Issues**:
   - Problems with acquiring tokens due to misconfigured scopes or permissions.

4. **Multi-Tenant Apps**:
   - If the application is multi-tenant, ensure that users from other tenants are providing the correct tenant information.

5. **User Not Found**:
   - User does not exist in the tenant or is not assigned to the application.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Confirm User Identity**:
   - Ask the user to log in using their full user principal name (UPN) which includes the tenant information.

2. **Check Application Settings**:
   - Navigate to Azure AD > App registrations. Confirm that your application is listed and configured with the required permissions, such as API permissions.

3. **Review Membership and Assignments**:
   - Check if the user is a member of the tenant and has been assigned to the application. 

4. **Use Tenant-Specific Endpoints**:
   - Ensure you are using endpoints formatted for your specific tenant, e.g., using `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/token`.

5. **Adjust Configuration for Multi-Tenant Applications**:
   - If your application is designed for multiple tenants, modify the settings to allow users from other tenants to log in.

6. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Enable logging in your application to capture additional details during the authentication process.

7. **Reach Out to Tenant Admin**:
   - If the user is unable to resolve the issue, advise them to contact their tenant administrator for further assistance.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure users know the correct format to use for their email or UPN when logging in.
- Consider the possibility of temporary outages or service disruptions in Azure AD.
- Ensure your application is up to date with Azure AD authentication libraries.

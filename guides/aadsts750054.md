### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS750054: "SAMLRequest or SAMLResponse must be present as query string parameters in HTTP request for SAML Redirect binding"

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Verify SAML Request/Response Parameters**: Check if the SAMLRequest or SAMLResponse parameters are indeed missing from the query string of the HTTP request.
2. **Confirm SAML Binding**: Ensure that the SAML binding method being used is SAML Redirect binding.
3. **Review Configuration**: Check your application's SAML configuration and make sure everything is set up correctly.

#### Common Issues:
- Missing SAMLRequest or SAMLResponse parameters in the query string.
- Incorrect SAML binding method being used.
- Misconfigured SAML settings in the application.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **Check Query String Parameters**:
   - Validate that the SAMLRequest or SAMLResponse parameters are present in the query string of the HTTP request.
   - If they are missing, regenerate the URL with the correct SAML parameters included.

2. **Ensure Correct SAML Binding**:
   - If using SAML Redirect binding, make sure the request is being sent using the appropriate method.
   - Check the SAML implementation documentation for your application to ensure the correct binding is being used.

3. **Verify Application Configuration**:
   - Double-check the SAML configuration in your application to confirm that the correct settings are in place.
   - Ensure that the Identity Provider (IdP) and Service Provider (SP) configurations match and are consistent.

4. **Debugging Tools**:
   - Utilize SAML validation tools or logging mechanisms to analyze the SAML flow and identify any discrepancies.
   - Enable verbose logging in your application to capture detailed information about the SAML request and response.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- **Test in Different Environments**: Try replicating the issue in a test environment to isolate the problem and troubleshoot without affecting the production environment.
- **Consult SAML Documentation**: Refer to the SAML protocol documentation for a deeper understanding of SAML Redirect binding and parameter requirements.
- **Engage Support Teams**: If the issue persists, reach out to your SSO provider or IT support team for further assistance in resolving the error.

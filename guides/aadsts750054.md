# AADSTS750054: SAMLRequest or SAMLResponse must be present as query string parameters in HTTP request for SAML Redirect binding. To learn more, see the troubleshooting article for errorAADSTS750054.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS750054

#### Overview
The error code AADSTS750054 indicates that a SAML request or SAML response is missing from the HTTP request, specifically when utilizing SAML Redirect binding. This error often occurs during the Single Sign-On (SSO) process between an Identity Provider (IdP) and a Service Provider (SP).

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Check the URL**: Ensure that the URL used for the SAML request contains either `SAMLRequest` or `SAMLResponse` as query string parameters.
2. **Review the Flow**: Understand the SSO flow being used and verify whether it adheres to SAML Redirect Binding standards.
3. **Identify the Context**: Determine whether the error occurred during the initiation of authentication (SAMLRequest) or during the assertion process (SAMLResponse).

### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **Incorrect URL Format**: The redirect URL may not properly encode the SAML request/response.
2. **Missing Parameters**: The parameters `SAMLRequest` or `SAMLResponse` may not be included in the request due to misconfiguration.
3. **Client-side Issues**: The client may manipulate or fail to send a properly constructed URL.
4. **Network Issues**: Interference in the network, such as firewalls or proxies, may strip necessary parameters from the URL.
5. **Browser Extensions**: Certain browser extensions (like ad blockers) can interfere with URL requests.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Verify SAML Request/Response Generation**:
   - Confirm that the SP is generating the `SAMLRequest` properly before redirect. Check the service logs for the specific requests sent.
  
2. **Check URLs in Redirects**:
   - Use the browser’s developer tools to monitor the network requests and check if the URLs redirect with the expected query parameters. 

3. **Modify Configuration**:
   - If using custom applications or middleware, ensure that SAML requests and responses are correctly formatted, and that all necessary parameters are being passed based on your SAML setup.

4. **Debugging**:
   - Use tools such as Fiddler or Postman to manually create the SAML request with required parameters to see if the issue persists outside of the application context.

5. **Review Logs**:
   - Check logs on both the IdP and SP. Look for any errors or messages that indicate what might have gone wrong during the SAML authentication flow.

6. **Testing with Different Browsers**:
   - Sometimes, browser settings or cache can cause issues. Test the authentication flow in different browsers or in incognito mode.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that your SAML configurations (entity IDs, certificates, etc.) are set up correctly across both the IdP and SP.
- Keep an eye on your application’s logs and the IdP logs for any indication of what might be causing the issue.
- If you are working with a managed service or third-party application, check whether there is known downtime or service interruptions.

### Advice for Data Collection
1. **Event Viewer logs**: Check the application logs in the Event Viewer for relevant warnings or error messages during the time the error occurred. Look for logs specific to the SSO process.
   
2. **Network Tracing**:
   - Use `netsh trace start` commands on Windows for collecting network traces.
   - Capture necessary network packets to analyze the HTTP requests and responses between the client and servers.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Use Fiddler to inspect HTTP requests, specifically checking the query parameters being sent and verifying the integrity of the SAML request/response.
   - Record the entire flow to identify where the parameters might be missing or altered.

By following this guide, you can systematically troubleshoot and resolve the AADSTS750054 error to ensure successful SAML authentication.

# AADSTS750054: SAMLRequest or SAMLResponse must be present as query string parameters in HTTP request for SAML Redirect binding. To learn more, see the troubleshooting article for errorAADSTS750054.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS750054

**Error Description**:  
AADSTS750054 indicates that the SAMLRequest or SAMLResponse parameters are missing from the query string of the HTTP request when using SAML Redirect binding for authentication with Azure Active Directory. 

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check the URL:** Verify the HTTP request URL to ensure that it includes the `SAMLRequest` or `SAMLResponse` parameters.
   
2. **Inspect HTTP Method:** Ensure that the request is a GET request, as SAML Redirect bindings require the use of GET with query parameters.

3. **Examine Browser Console/Network Logs:** Open developer tools in the browser and inspect the network traffic. Look for the specifics of the request to see if the necessary parameters are included.

4. **Verify SSO Configuration:** Confirm that the Single Sign-On (SSO) configuration for the application is correctly set up in Azure AD.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Missing Parameters:** The `SAMLRequest` or `SAMLResponse` parameters are not included in the request URL.

2. **Incorrect Redirect URI:** The application redirection URI may not properly point to the expected endpoint for handling SAML messages.

3. **Configuration Errors:** The SAML settings in Azure AD might be incorrectly configured, leading to improper redirects.

4. **Timing Issues:** The authentication flow might be interrupted by timing issues or by the application not properly issuing the redirect.

5. **Firewall/Network Issues:** Security devices or network configurations might be altering the request parameters.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Review Application Code:**
   - Check the application code that initiates the SAML request to ensure that it constructs a valid URL with the `SAMLRequest` query string parameter.

2. **Modify Redirect URIs:**
   - If the application uses a custom redirect URI, ensure it matches the one registered in Azure AD. Update the redirect URIs in Azure AD if necessary.

3. **Verify Protocol Binding:**
   - Confirm that the application is configured to use SAML Redirect binding as expected, and that there are no mismatches in the specified binding method.

4. **Enable Debugging:**
   - Enable additional logging in the application to trace the flow of the SAML request, which helps identify where the parameters may be omitted.

5. **Check Azure AD Configuration:**
   - Log in to Azure AD and navigate to "Enterprise Applications". Select your application, go to "Single sign-on", and verify that all settings related to SAML are properly configured.

6. **Testing Changes:**
   - After making changes, conduct tests to see if the application now successfully includes the required query parameters. Use tools such as Postman or Fiddler to simulate the requests if needed.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Encoding and Decoding:** Ensure that the SAMLRequest and SAMLResponse are URL-encoded adequately, as improper encoding can lead to data loss in the parameters.
  
- **Certificate Issues:** Verify that the signing certificate used in SAML requests is valid and not expired, as this can also cause unrelated issues.

- **Be Mindful of Caching:** Ensure that caching mechanisms do not store outdated request information which may suppress the new parameters or information.

### Advice for Data Collection

- **Capture HTTP Requests:** Use tools like Fiddler, Charles Proxy, or browser developer tools to log the requests and review the query parameters being sent in SAML messages.
  
- **Look at the Application Logs:** Review your applicationâ€™s logs to capture any exceptions, errors, or failures related to the SAML authentication attempts.

- **Contact Support:** If the issue persists after following the steps provided, consider reaching out to Azure support or your software vendor for further assistance.

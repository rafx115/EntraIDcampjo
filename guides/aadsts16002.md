wasn't met.

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:** 

1. **Confirm the Error:** Ensure that the error code AADSTS16002 is consistently

   appearing when trying to access or use the application.
2. **Check Application Configuration:** Validate the configuration settings for

   the application in the Azure portal.

**Common Issues:** 

1. **Incorrect App-Specified SID:** The Security Identifier (SID) specified by

   the application may not be correct or may not match the user's SID.
2. **Session-State Mismatch:** The application's session state may not be

   correctly managed, leading to the error.
3. **Permissions Issue:** Insufficient permissions or misconfiguration related

   to the user's identity or access could trigger this error.

**Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:** 

1. **Verify the App-Specified SID:** 

   * Confirm if the SID specified by the application in the authentication

     process is accurate.
   * Check if the SID matches the user's identity information in the system.

2. **Review and Adjust Session Handling:** 

   * Review the session management code within the application to ensure it

     aligns with the requirements.
   * Validate that the session information is being correctly stored, retrieved,

     and compared during authentication.

3. **Check Permissions and Identity Configuration:** 

   * Verify the permissions assigned to the user and ensure they meet the

     requirements specified by the application.
   * Review the user's identity configuration in Azure Active Directory to

     ensure consistency with the application's requirements.

4. **Test with Different Users:** 

   * Attempt to replicate the issue with different user accounts to determine if

     it's user-specific or a broader configuration problem.

5. **Reset App Configuration and Secrets:**    * If all else fails, reset the 
application configuration in the Azure portal

     and regenerate any client secrets or keys used for authentication.

**Additional Notes or Considerations:**


* **Documentation and Support:** Consult the official Microsoft documentation

  for Azure Active Directory error codes for further insight.

* **Logs and Monitoring:** Utilize Azure's monitoring tools and logs to track

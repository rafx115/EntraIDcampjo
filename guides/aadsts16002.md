# AADSTS16002: AppSessionSelectionInvalid - The app-specified SID requirement wasn't met.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS16002

#### Overview
Error code AADSTS16002 indicates that the application session selection requirements defined by the application were not met. This commonly occurs in scenarios involving Single Sign-On (SSO) or when applications define requirements for the session identifier (SID) that must be fulfilled during authentication.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Verify Application Configuration**:
   - Review the application's registration settings in the Azure portal to ensure that all configuration settings are accurate.
   - Check the application's manifest for any specific SID requirements.

2. **Check User and Group Membership**:
   - Ensure that the user attempting to authenticate is a member of the required groups if the application is configured to limit access.

3. **Review Authentication Requests**:
   - Examine the request made by the application to identify what specific SID requirements were specified.

#### Common Issues that Cause this Error
1. **Missing SID**:
   - The application expects a session ID or specific claims that are not being provided during the authentication process.

2. **Session Expiration**:
   - The user's session may have expired, and the necessary SID is no longer valid.

3. **Invalid Application Registration**:
   - Misconfigurations in the applicationâ€™s registration or mismatches between expected and actual configurations.

4. **Policies Not Met**:
   - Conditional access policies or other security mechanisms may be blocking the session due to not meeting certain criteria.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Review Application Requirements**:
   - Check the documentation or guidelines for the application being used to determine what specific SID or session claims are required.

2. **Inspect Authentication Flow**:
   - Verify how the authentication flow is set up. This can often be found in the application settings.
   - If applicable, modify the application to request appropriate session identifiers that align with the necessary requirements.

3. **Update Application Manifest**:
   - If certain claims or SIDs need to be included, edit the application manifest in the Azure portal to include these claims.

4. **Test with Different User Accounts**:
   - Attempt to authenticate using different user accounts to determine if the problem is user-specific.

5. **Check Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Navigate to Azure Active Directory > Security > Conditional Access to review any active policies that might impede the session creation.

6. **Session Monitoring**:
   - Utilize session monitoring tools or logging to track sessions to see where the failure is occurring within the process.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that all identities in Azure AD are synchronized correctly if you are using hybrid identities (on-premises and cloud).
- Check whether the application requires consent for certain permissions and that those permissions have been granted by an administrator.

#### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Check the Application and System logs for entries related to authentication failures or issues encountered during login attempts.

- **Network Tracing**:
   - Utilize tools like **NetTrace** or **Fiddler** to capture HTTP requests and responses during the authentication process. Look for any failed requests or error responses that may contain more detailed error messages.

- **Logs Review**:
   - Look for specific error codes in the response from Azure AD or detailed messages in the payload that might indicate what SID or claims were expected but not received.

Gathering this information can provide better insights into what specifically is causing the AADSTS16002 error and aid in quicker resolution.

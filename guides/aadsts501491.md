# AADSTS501491: InvalidCodeChallengeMethodInvalidSize - Invalid size of Code_Challenge parameter.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS501491 Error Code: InvalidCodeChallengeMethodInvalidSize

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Identify the Context**: Understand when and where the error is occurring (e.g., during authentication, authorization process).
2. **Review Code_Challenge Logic**: Check the code challenge method and size being used in the current implementation.
3. **Review the Azure AD Integration**: Ensure that the Azure AD configuration matches the expected requirements for code challenges.
4. **Check Logs**: Review any error logs, Azure AD logs, or application logs for more detailed information on the error.

#### Common Issues:
- **Incorrect Code Challenge Method**: Using an unsupported or incorrect code challenge method can lead to this error.
- **Code Challenge Parameter Size**: The code challenge parameter size must be accurate and within the supported limits.
- **Mismatch in Implementation**: Inconsistencies between the client-side implementation and the Azure AD settings can cause this issue.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Verify Code Challenge Method**:
   - Ensure that the code challenge method being used aligns with the requirements of Azure AD.
   - Accepted methods typically include S256 (SHA-256 hash) or plain.

2. **Check Code Challenge Size**:
   - Confirm that the size of the Code_Challenge parameter is within the expected limits.
   - Azure AD generally requires a specific size range for code challenge parameters.

3. **Update Parameters**:
   - Adjust the Code_Challenge parameter size if needed to comply with Azure AD's requirements.
   - Reconfigure your application or authentication flow to match the correct size.

4. **Review Azure AD Configuration**:
   - Check the Azure AD App Registration settings related to code challenges for any misconfigurations.
   - Make sure that the configuration of code challenge methods and sizes is coherent with your implementation.

5. **Test Authentication Flow**:
   - Perform a test authentication flow to verify that the error has been resolved.
   - Monitor logs and capture any new error messages that may help further troubleshoot the issue.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- Ensure that the Authorization Code Flow or PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) is correctly implemented.
- Make sure that any changes in the code challenge logic are reflected consistently across your application and Azure AD settings.
- In the case of third-party libraries or SDKs, ensure that they support the required code challenge methods and sizes.

#### Documentation for Guidance:
- Microsoft Azure AD Documentation: [Azure AD Code Challenge Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#pkce)
- PKCE RFC Document: [RFC 7636 - Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7636/)

By following these steps and guidelines, you should be able to troubleshoot and address the AADSTS501491 error related to an InvalidCodeChallengeMethodInvalidSize successfully.

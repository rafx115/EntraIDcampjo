# AADSTS501491: InvalidCodeChallengeMethodInvalidSize - Invalid size of Code_Challenge parameter.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS501491

**Error Code:** AADSTS501491  
**Description:** InvalidCodeChallengeMethodInvalidSize - Invalid size of Code_Challenge parameter.

This error typically occurs during OAuth 2.0 authorization flows when a code challenge parameter does not meet size or format expectations defined in the specification. The challenge method ensures that the request is valid and prevents certain types of attacks.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Understand the OAuth 2.0 Flow:**
   - Determine the context in which the error occurred (e.g., during authorization code acquisition).
   - Review the basic components of the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange).

2. **Examine the Request:**
   - Capture the exact HTTP request that led to the error.
   - Check the parameters being sent, particularly `code_challenge` and `code_challenge_method`.

3. **Check Client Configuration:**
   - Validate that the application's settings in Azure AD correctly align with PKCE requirements.
   - Ensure the client_id used in the request is registered and enabled in Azure AD.

#### Common Issues Causing This Error

1. **Incorrect Size of `code_challenge`:**
   - The `code_challenge` must be a Base64 URL-encoded string. Its size is often impacted by the hashing algorithm used (e.g., SHA-256).
   - If using SHA-256, the resulting `code_challenge` should be exactly 43 to 44 characters long when Base64 URL-encoded.

2. **Improper Method Specification:**
   - Verify that the `code_challenge_method` is set correctly (e.g., `S256` for SHA-256). If it's not specified, the default should be `plain`, which does not use hashing and may not be appropriate for all scenarios.

3. **Encoding Issues:**
   - Ensure that the `code_challenge` is properly URL-encoded and adheres to the standards.

4. **Incompatibility with Azure AD Configuration:**
   - Confirm that the application is registered for PKCE usage in the Azure AD app registration.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Check the Code Challenge Generation:**
   - Ensure that the code challenge is generated using a secure method (e.g., hashing a random string with SHA-256).
   - Example for generating a code challenge:
     ```python
     import hashlib
     import base64

     def generate_code_challenge(code_verifier):
         hashed = hashlib.sha256(code_verifier.encode()).digest()
         return base64.urlsafe_b64encode(hashed).rstrip(b'=').decode()
     ```

2. **Validate Parameters:**
   - Confirm that the `code_challenge` parameter being sent is the expected length and format.
   - Check that there are no extraneous characters or encoding issues.

3. **Adjust the Application Registration Settings:**
   - Log into the Azure portal and navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations.
   - Ensure that `Allow public client flows` is set correctly if your application requires it.

4. **Test Different Code Challenge Methods:**
   - If you are experiencing issues with SHA-256, you can test with the `plain` method for debugging purposes (though it is not recommended for production use).

5. **Attempt Re-Registration:**
   - In some scenarios, re-registering the application in Azure AD may reset any misconfigured settings.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Always be cautious about security practices when using OAuth 2.0 and PKCE.
- Ensure that your application's secret is kept secure and not embedded in front-end code.

#### Documentation References

- Microsoftâ€™s official documentation on [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow).
- OAuth 2.0 RFC 6749 and PKCE RFC 7636.

#### Data Collection for Further Analysis 

- **Event Viewer Logs:** 
  - Look for any OAuth-related errors or application logs in the Event Viewer, particularly under Application and System logs.

- **Network Tracing and Monitoring:**
  - Use tools like Fiddler or Postman to inspect outgoing requests. Verify the integrity of the parameters being sent.
  - Capture network traces (NetTrace) to examine the raw HTTP requests and responses for additional context.

- **Azure Logs:**
  - Consider enabling logging in Azure AD to track and review authentication requests and responses, which will provide insights into where the failure occurs.

By following these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the AADSTS501491 error effectively.

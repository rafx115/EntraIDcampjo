#### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Transient Network Issues**:
   - Temporary disruptions in connectivity to Azure services can lead to this error.

2. **Service Limits**:
   - Exceeding Azure AD’s service limits such as authentication request limits can cause errors.

3. **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**:
   - Problems with the Multi-Factor Authentication configuration or the MFA provider can lead to transient errors.

4. **Account Lockout**:
   - The account might be temporarily locked due to multiple failed login attempts.

5. **Token Expiration**:
   - Expired or invalid tokens can lead to authentication failures.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Retry the Authentication**:
   - Since this is a transient error, the simplest resolution is to try the authentication process again after a waiting period, typically a few minutes.

2. **Check Azure Active Directory Settings**:
   - Ensure that the user account is not locked out or disabled.
   - Check for any conditional access policies that might affect login.

3. **Review MFA Configuration**:
   - Verify that the MFA service is correctly configured and operational. Make sure the user has a valid second factor configured.

4. **Monitor Service Health**:
   - Keep an eye on the Azure Service Health to detect any ongoing issues that could be affecting authentication.

5. **Contact Support**:
   - If the problem persists, contact Microsoft support, especially if the issue is widespread or affects multiple users.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Error Logging**: Always take note of the exact time the error occurs to correlate with any service outages or incidents reported by Microsoft.
- **User Education**: Inform users about potential transient errors and encourage them to retry after a few minutes.
- **System Updates**: Ensure that all relying systems and applications are up-to-date to prevent compatibility issues.

#### Advice for Data Collection

If you need to gather more detailed diagnostic data, consider the following methods:

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Check the **Windows Event Viewer** for any relevant logs under Windows Logs > Application or Security, particularly related to authentication failures.

2. **Network Traces (NetTrace)**:
   - Use **Microsoft Message Analyzer** or other network analysis tools to capture network traffic. Ensure that you filter for relevant traffic heading to Azure services during the authentication attempt.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Use **Fiddler** to capture HTTP/S traffic. Monitor requests to Azure endpoints (like login.microsoftonline.com) during the authentication process. Look for any failed responses or significant delays in requests.

By systematically following this guide, you should be able to diagnose and potential resolve the AADSTS50087 error effectively.

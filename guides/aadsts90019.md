**Initial Diagnostic Steps:** 

1. **Verify User Information:** Ensure that the user attempting to sign-in has

   the correct Microsoft account credentials.

   to the Microsoft Authentication service for any formatting errors or missing
   information.
3. **Confirm Authentication Endpoint:** Ensure that the user is accessing the

   correct Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication endpoint for the tenant.

**Common Issues that Cause this Error:** 

1. **Incorrect Sign-In URL:** Users may be redirected to the wrong Azure AD

   sign-in URL, causing the tenant identifier to be missing from the request.
2. **Invalid Tenant Information:** The tenant ID or domain provided in the

   request might be incorrect or missing, leading to identification issues.
3. **Misconfigured Application:** Issues in the application registration

   settings, such as incorrect redirect URIs or permissions, can trigger this
   error.

**Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:** 

1. **Ensure Correct Sign-In URL:**    * Verify that users are signing in using 
the correct URL:

     https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize.
2. **Check Tenant Information:**    * Double-check the tenant ID or domain used 
in the request to make sure they

     are accurate.
3. **Review Application Registration:**    * Go to the Azure Portal and check 
the configuration settings of the

     registered application.
   * Verify that the redirect URIs, permissions, and other settings are

     correctly configured.
4. **Clear Browser Cache and Cookies:**    * Clear the browser cache and cookies 
to eliminate any cached data that might

     be causing issues with the sign-in process.
5. **Try Incognito/Private Browsing:**    * Test the sign-in process in an 
incognito/private browser window to rule out

     any browser extensions or stored data causing the problem.

**Additional Notes or Considerations:**


* **Network Issues:** Sometimes network connectivity issues can also lead to

  this error. Ensure that the user has a stable internet connection.

# AADSTS90019: MissingTenantRealm - Microsoft Entra ID was unable to determine the tenant identifier from the request.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS90019

#### Overview
The error code *AADSTS90019* indicates that Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) was unable to determine the tenant identifier from the request. This can occur in scenarios involving authentication requests where the tenant information is not clearly specified or recognized by the Microsoft Entra ID service.

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check the Request URL**:
   - Ensure that the request URL is correctly formed. Look for the following:
     - `tenant` identifier in the URL path (e.g., `/mytenant.onmicrosoft.com/...`).
     - Correct configuration of Azure Active Directory if using multi-tenant applications.

2. **Examine Application Registration**:
   - Verify the application is correctly registered in the Azure portal.
   - Ensure that the "Redirect URI" settings match those used in the request.

3. **Validate Tenant Name**:
   - Make sure the tenant name used in the request (if any) is correct and matches the tenant registered in Azure AD.

4. **Context Context**:
   - Determine if the endpoint being used requires tenant-specific information (like `/common`, `/organizations`, or the specific tenant ID).

### Common Issues That Cause this Error

1. **Missing Tenant Information**:
   - The request is made to an endpoint without specifying the tenant, leading to ambiguity.

2. **Invalid or Incorrect Tenant Configuration**:
   - The specified tenant might not exist or could have been mistyped.

3. **Improper Client Configuration**:
   - The Client ID or Secret may not be configured properly in the application.

4. **Incorrect OAuth Flow**:
   - The chosen OAuth flow may not support the specified tenant requirements (e.g., using "common" for specific tenant resources).

---

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Specify the Tenant**:
   - If the application is multi-tenant, ensure that the request specifies the correct tenant identifier.
   - Modify your request URLs to explicitly include the tenant ID or domain.

   Example:
   - Instead of `/oauth2/v2.0/token`, use `/mytenant.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/v2.0/token`.

2. **Configure the Application Properly**:
   - Verify that the application's registration in Azure AD has the correct configurations such as:
     - Correct Redirect URIs.
     - Supported account types that align with your tenant type.

3. **Test with Different Endpoints**:
   - Utilize `/common`, `/organizations`, or `/consumers` in the request based on the targeted audience.
   - Example:
     - For multi-tenant applications: 
       - `/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id={client_id}&response_type=id_token&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&scope={scope}&response_mode=query&nonce={nonce}&state={state}`

4. **Logs and Auditing**:
   - Check Azure AD audit logs for any blocked or failed sign-in notifications that can provide clues about tenant issues.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Ensure that your application supports querying tenant-based access, as some scenarios may require delegated permissions or user consent.
- Even in multi-tenant scenarios, using tenant-specific endpoints may be more reliable for certain application designs.
- Consider using tools like Postman to simulate the requests and ensure the parameters passed are as expected.

### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Check Windows Event Viewer under Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > AAD > Admin for any relevant logs during authentication events.

2. **Network Tracing Tool (NetTrace)**:
   - Use NetTrace to capture network traffic. Analyze the authentication requests and responses for any discrepancies or issues.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Set up Fiddler to intercept HTTP(S) requests. Look for the headers and payload being sent to the Microsoft Entra ID service to ensure all necessary parameters are included.

4. **Postman or Curl Requests**:
   - Create sample requests using these tools to isolate and reproduce issues, verify the success of different endpoints, and compare responses.

By following these troubleshooting strategies and steps, you should be able to address the `AADSTS90019` error more effectively.

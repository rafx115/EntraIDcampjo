# AADSTS28002: Provided value for the input parameter scope '{scope}' isn't valid when requesting an access token. Specify a valid scope.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS28002 Error

#### Error Overview
- **Error Code**: AADSTS28002
- **Description**: "Provided value for the input parameter scope '{scope}' isn't valid when requesting an access token. Specify a valid scope."
- This error typically indicates that the application is attempting to request an access token with an invalid or improperly formatted scope.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Check the Error Message**: Review the full error message to see if it specifies which scope is invalid.
2. **Identify the Application**: Determine which application (client) is generating this error during the token request.
3. **Scope Review**: Gather a list of all scopes that the application is requesting. Check for typographical errors or incorrect formatting in the scope string.

### Common Issues Causing This Error
1. **Invalid Scopes**: The scope specified in the request may not exist in the Azure AD (e.g., custom scopes not configured correctly).
2. **Misconfigured API Permissions**: The application may request scopes that have not been granted consent in Azure AD.
3. **Scope Format Issues**: The format of the requested scopes might be incorrect (e.g., missing the resource).
4. **Application Registration Issues**: Scopes may not be properly defined in the Azure AD application registration.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Verify Available Scopes**:
   - Log in to the Azure Portal.
   - Navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations.
   - Find the application in question and select it.
   - Under "API permissions," confirm the available scopes for the API you are trying to access.

2. **Correct the Scope in the Request**:
   - Ensure the scope string is formatted correctly:
     - Scopes should typically be in the format `api://{client-id}/{scope-name}` for custom scopes.
     - For Microsoft APIs, use the format `https://{resource}.azure.com/.default` or the specific scope names.
   - Ensure you are requesting only scopes that are defined and available for the app.

3. **Grant Necessary Permissions**:
   - In the Azure Portal, check if the application has been granted the necessary API permission consent:
     - If permissions are required, click on "Grant admin consent for [Your Organization]" after configuring the permissions.

4. **Retry Access Token Request**:
   - After ensuring all settings are correct, make a new access token request with the correctly defined scopes and confirm if the issue persists.

5. **Check for Conflicting Settings**:
   - If there are multiple applications interacting (e.g., backend and frontend), ensure that they are aligned in terms of permissions and scopes.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that any changes made in Azure AD (like permissions or scope configurations) are allowed to propagate and may require some minutes to take effect.
- If the application uses different environments (e.g., production vs. development), confirm that you are checking the correct application registration corresponding to the environment you are working with.

### Documentation for Guidance
- [Azure AD App Registrations Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)
- [Set up application permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-app-permissions)
- [Scopes and permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview)

### Data Collection for Investigating the Issue
- **Event Viewer Logs**: Check for application logs related to the Azure AD authentication event. Pay close attention to the timestamp of token request events.
- **Network Traces (Nettrace, Fiddler)**:
  - **Fiddler**: Use Fiddler to capture HTTP traffic to identify the exact token request being sent, including the scopes being requested.
  - **Network Traces**: Capture network traces to find any issues in the request/response cycle during the token acquisition process.

By thoroughly following this troubleshooting guide, many instances of the AADSTS28002 error can be resolved effectively.

## Troubleshooting Steps

When encountering the error code AADSTS28002 with the description stating that
the provided value for the input parameter scope is not valid when requesting an
access token, it is important to follow a systematic approach to troubleshoot
and resolve the issue. Below is a detailed troubleshooting guide to address this
specific error.


### Initial Diagnostic Steps:

1. **Verify the Scope Parameter**: Confirm the scope parameter values being used
   in the request.
2. **Review Authentication Process**: Ensure you understand the authentication
   flow and which scopes are allowed for the requested token.
3. **Check Azure AD Configuration**: Review the scopes configured in Azure AD
   and verify if the requested scope is valid.
4. **Inspect Request Headers**: Look at the headers being sent in the request
   for any discrepancies related to the scope parameter.


### Common Issues Causing the Error:


* Incorrect or misspelled scope values in the request.

* Requested scope is not defined in the Azure AD application configuration.

* Insufficient permissions associated with the scope being requested.

* Mismatch between the requested scope and the token endpoint configuration.


### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:

1. **Verify Scope Values**:

   * Check the scope parameter in the request and ensure it matches with the

     valid scopes defined for the application.
   * Correct any typographical errors in the scope values.

2. **Update Azure AD App Registration**:

   * Go to Azure Portal > Azure AD > App Registrations.

   * Find the relevant application and navigate to the 'Expose an API' section.

   * Add or update the required scopes for the application.

3. **Check Permissions**:

   * Ensure that the signed-in user or client application has the necessary

     permissions to request the specified scope.
   * Verify the consent process if applicable.

4. **Review Access Policies**:

   * Check the Azure AD access policies and make sure they allow the requested

     scope.
   * Adjust the policies if needed to accommodate the requested scope.

5. **Monitor Token Endpoint**:
   * Monitor the interactions with the token endpoint to identify any issues

     with the scope parameter.
   * Look for specific error responses or warnings related to the scope

     validation.


### Additional Notes or Considerations:


* **Token Lifetime**: Consider the token lifetime settings, as the error could

  also be triggered by an expired or revoked token.

* **API Permissions**: Ensure that the requested scope aligns with the

  permissions defined for the API resource.

* **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging mechanisms to track the

  scope-related errors and improve troubleshooting in the future.

# AADSTS501481: The Code_Verifier doesn't match the code_challenge supplied in the authorization request.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The error code AADSTS501481 refers to an issue with the OAuth 2.0 Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) implementation, indicating that the `code_verifier` provided during the token request does not match the `code_challenge` sent during the initial authorization request.

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Understand the Flow**: Familiarize yourself with the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE. When the client application requests authorization, it generates a `code_verifier` and a corresponding `code_challenge`. The challenge is sent with the authorization request, and the verifier is sent during the token request.
   
2. **Review Application Code**: Check the client application code's flow, especially the authorization and token request segments, to ensure the corresponding values are being handled correctly.

3. **Confirm Endpoints**: Verify that you are using the correct Azure Active Directory (AAD) endpoints for authentication and token requests.

#### Common Issues That Cause this Error
1. **Mismatch of `code_verifier` and `code_challenge`**:
   - If the `code_verifier` used in the token request does not match the `code_challenge` sent in the authorization request, this error will occur.

2. **Encoding Issues**:
   - Ensure that both the `code_verifier` and `code_challenge` are being generated and sent following correct URL encoding rules.

3. **State/Session Issues**:
   - If sessions or states are not maintained properly between the authorization and token exchanges, this can lead to mismatches.

4. **Client State Resetting**: 
   - A browser refresh or inadvertent page navigation may reset the `code_verifier` before itâ€™s sent.

5. **Length or Character Constraints**: 
   - Ensure that the `code_verifier` meets the length and character constraints specified by the PKCE standard.

6. **Complex Refactoring**:
   - If there are any complex refactoring changes in the code managing authentication flow, they may inadvertently alter the logic of how the `code_verifier` is handled.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Examine the Authorization Code Request**:
   - Ensure your authorization request correctly includes the `code_challenge` parameter and that it's being constructed using an appropriate hashing method (`S256` or plain).

2. **Verify the Token Request**:
   - In the token request, include the correct `code_verifier` that matches the initial `code_challenge`. This must be exactly the same value that was generated before the authorization request.

3. **Maintain State Properly**:
   - Store the `code_verifier` in a session or temporary storage, ensuring that it is referenced correctly when making the token request.

4. **Check for Encoding**:
   - Confirm that your client application correctly encodes both the `code_verifier` and `code_challenge`. If necessary, log the values before sending, to assist in debugging.

5. **Testing**:
   - Use multiple scenarios to capture the state of both values at the time of the authorization and token requests. Manually or programmatically posting back the requests can assure they are in sync.

6. **Review Logs**:
   - If problems persist, examine any server or application logs for any anomalies related to the authentication requests.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **PKCE Best Practices**: Ensure that you are following best practices when implementing PKCE, including using strong, high-entropy values for the `code_verifier`.
- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: If you are using libraries (like OAuth clients), ensure they are up to date as they may have benefits or fixes for handling PKCE.

#### Documentation for Guidance
- Official Microsoft Documentation on [PKCE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#proof-key-for-code-exchange-pkce)
- OAuth 2.0 Specification on [PKCE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)

#### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer Logs**: Look for application logs or security logs that might provide insights into authentication failures or issues.
- **Network Tracing**: Utilize tools such as Fiddler or Wireshark to capture network traffic. Filter for OAuth requests to review the parameters being sent and received.
- **NetTrace**: If your application is consuming a specific library that supports creating traces, collect those for detailed insights.

By following the steps and advice in this guide, you should be able to troubleshoot and resolve the AADSTS501481 error effectively.

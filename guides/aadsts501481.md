# AADSTS501481: The Code_Verifier doesn't match the code_challenge supplied in the authorization request.


## Troubleshooting Steps
**Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS501481 Error Code: The Code_Verifier doesn't match the code_challenge supplied in the authorization request**

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:**
1. Verify the architecture and flow of your authentication process.
2. Check the implementation of PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) in your authorization request.
3. Confirm that all parameters related to PKCE are being correctly generated and exchanged during the authorization flow.

**Common Issues that Cause this Error:**
1. Mismatch between the code_verifier and code_challenge values.
2. Code_challenge being generated incorrectly in the initial authorization request.
3. Lost state during the authentication flow leading to discrepancies in code_verifier and code_challenge values.

**Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:**
1. Review the code generation and exchange steps for PKCE in your application.
2. Ensure that the code_challenge method used (S256 or plain) matches between the OAuth authorization request and token exchange request.
3. Double-check that the code_verifier sent in the token exchange request matches the code_verifier used to generate the code_challenge.
4. If the error persists, try regenerating the code_challenge and code_verifier values and retry the authentication flow.

**Additional Notes or Considerations:**
- Maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of the code_verifier and code_challenge values throughout the authentication flow.
- Regularly audit and review the PKCE implementation in your application to avoid such errors.

**Documentation for Guidance:**
- Microsoft Identity Platform documentation: [Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#pkce)
- OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: [RFC 7636](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)

By following these troubleshooting steps and paying attention to the details of PKCE implementation, you should be able to resolve the AADSTS501481 error related to mismatched code_verifier and code_challenge values.

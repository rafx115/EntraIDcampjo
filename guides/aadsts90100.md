---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps

- **Review the Error Message**: Take note of the complete error message and any associated details. This may provide clues about which parameter is causing the issue.
- **Check the Request**: If this error occurs during API calls, inspect the request payload and URL parameters for any missing or malformed data.
- **Identify the Context**: Determine if the error occurs during user sign-in, token acquisition, or API calls, as this can narrow down potential causes.

### 2. Common Issues That Cause This Error

- **Empty Parameters**: Any required parameter for the request is empty. Verify that all mandatory fields are populated.
- **Invalid Values**: The parameter values provided may not conform to expected formats (such as strings that must be a certain length, numbers that must fall within a range).
- **Misconfigured Redirect URIs**: For authentication flows, make sure that your redirect URIs are properly configured in Azure AD.
- **Incorrect Scope Parameters**: The scope might be improperly specified or empty.
- **Client ID / Secret Issues**: Make sure that the application is registered correctly in Azure AD and that you're using the correct Client ID and Client Secret values.

### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

#### Step 1: Validate Request Parameters

- Inspect your request to ensure that all required parameters are included and correctly formatted.
- Commonly required parameters include:
  - `client_id`
  - `client_secret`
  - `resource` or `scope`
  - `redirect_uri` (for authorization flows)
  - `grant_type`

#### Step 2: Refer to Azure Documentation

- Use Microsoft’s Azure AD documentation to verify that you are using the correct parameters for your application type (web, mobile, daemon, etc.). 
  - Link: [Azure Active Directory Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/)
  
#### Step 3: Test API Calls Manually

- Use tools like Postman or curl to manually test the API with the same parameters being provided in the application. This can help isolate whether the issue is with the application code or the request itself.

#### Step 4: Examine Application Configuration

- Go to the Azure portal and navigate to **Azure Active Directory > App registrations** and:
  - Confirm that all necessary permissions are granted.
  - Validate that the application configuration matches what is in your code (Client ID, Secret, Redirect URIs).
  
#### Step 5: Check Azure AD Sign-in Logs

- Review the logs in Azure AD to see if additional details for the error are provided.
  - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory > Sign-ins**. Look for your application’s failed sign-in entries and review their details.

### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations

- Make sure you're not accidentally omitting parameters in production that are present in development.
- Check for any typos or case sensitivity issues in parameter names.
- Ensure that the API version you are calling is accurate and supports the parameters you are using.

### 5. Documentation

- For more details about error codes and troubleshooting, refer to:
  - [Azure AD Error Codes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aadsts-error-codes) 
  - [Microsoft Identity platform documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/)

### 6. Test the Documentation Can Be Reachable

- You can access the documentation provided in step 5. If unable to reach it, verify your internet connection or check for any temporary issues with Azure services.

### 7. Advice for Data Collection

- Collect all relevant data such as:
  - Time of the error occurrence
  - Log files interested in authentication attempts
  - Complete request and response payloads showing the expected vs. actual values
  - Screenshots of error messages, if applicable.

By following this guide, you will systematically analyze and work through the AADSTS90100 error, allowing you to identify and rectify the underlying issues effectively. If the problem persists, consider reaching out to Azure support with the collected data for further assistance.

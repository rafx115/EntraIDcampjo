## Troubleshooting Steps
## Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS900236

### Error Code
**AADSTS900236:** "InvalidRequestSamlPropertyUnsupported - The SAML authentication request property '{propertyName}' isn't supported and must not be set."

### Overview
This error indicates that a SAML authentication request has included a property that is not supported by Azure Active Directory (AAD). The `{propertyName}` will indicate the specific attribute that is causing the problem.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Review the Error Message**: Identify the `{propertyName}` mentioned in the error message.
2. **Determine the Context**: Understand when and where the error occurs (e.g., during login, SSO, application access).
3. **Environment Check**: Verify the environment (production, development, etc.) and any recent changes made (updates, new configurations).
4. **SAML Configuration Overview**: Collect existing SAML configurations to understand what properties are in use.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error
1. **Unsupported Attributes in SAML Request**: Including attributes that Azure AD does not support (e.g., `AuthnContextClassRef` settings that are not supported).
2. **Misconfiguration of SAML Settings**: Incorrect application configuration in Azure AD or in SAML service provider settings.
3. **Incompatible Service Providers**: The service provider may be configured to send SAML properties that Azure AD cannot process.
4. **Version Mismatch**: Using an outdated SAML version that Azure AD does not fully support.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Identify the Unsupported Property**:
   - Read the full error response, focusing on the `{propertyName}`.
   
2. **Check Documentation**:
   - Reference [Microsoft SAML documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/single-sign-on-saml-protocol) to see supported properties and attributes.

3. **Validate SAML Requests**:
   - Use tools like SAML Tracer (Firefox) or SAML Chrome Panel to inspect SAML requests and examine what attributes are being sent.

4. **Adjust the SAML Request**:
   - If you control the identity provider or service provider configurations, remove or adjust the unsupported properties from the SAML assertions.
   - Specifically, if `{propertyName}` refers to an attribute that Azure AD does not handle (like certain custom claims), remove those properties entirely.

5. **Consult Service Provider Documentation**:
   - Review the settings for the SAML service provider to ensure they adhere strictly to Azure ADâ€™s supported configurations.

6. **Testing after Configuration Changes**:
   - After making changes, attempt to initiate the SAML request again to see if the error persists.

7. **Seek Community Support**:
   - If the issue remains unresolved, reach out to forums or Microsoft support, providing detailed information about your usage scenario, configuration, and specific errors.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that all systems involved (IdP, SP, Azure AD) are in sync regarding the supported SAML properties and versions.
- Keep SAML libraries and service providers up to date to avoid compatibility issues.

### Documentation for Further Guidance
- [Azure Active Directory SAML authentication documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/single-sign-on-saml-protocol)
- [SAML Metadata documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/saml-metadata)

### Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer Logs, NetTrace, Fiddler)
- **Event Viewer Logs**: Check the Performance and Diagnostic logs for any SAML-related error messages. Look under Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Application-Experience.
- **NetTrace**: Use [Microsoft Network Monitor](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4865) or [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) to capture network traffic and analyze SAML assertions sent during authentication.
- **Fiddler**: Capture HTTP traffic with Fiddler to inspect requests and responses for SAML flows, particularly looking at HTTP headers and payloads during the authentication flow.

### Conclusion
By following the above troubleshooting guide, you should be able to resolve the AADSTS900236 error effectively. Always ensure that changes made to SAML configurations are well-documented and tested in a safe environment before applying them in production.

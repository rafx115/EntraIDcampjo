# AADSTS221000: DeviceOnlyTokensNotSupportedByResource - The resource isn't configured to accept device-only tokens.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS221000

**Error Description:**
The error code AADSTS221000 with the message "DeviceOnlyTokensNotSupportedByResource - The resource isn't configured to accept device-only tokens" indicates that the application or resource you are trying to access does not support tokens that are specifically issued for devices only. This can happen when a device authentication method is used incorrectly in a context where user authentication is required.

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Understand the Context:**
   - Identify which application or resource is generating the error.
   - Determine the authentication method being used (e.g., device code flow, client credentials, etc.).

2. **Check User vs Device Context:**
   - Verify whether the intended flow is meant for a user authentication or a device authentication.
   - Ensure you are using the correct identity representation.

3. **Review Documentation:**
   - Consult Azure AD documentation regarding the configurations and supported authentication flows for the specific resource.

### Common Issues That Cause This Error

1. **Misconfiguration in Azure AD:**
   - The resource (API/Service) is not configured to accept device-only tokens. Some resources require user authentication and will reject device-only tokens.

2. **Incorrect Authentication Flow:**
   - Using a device authorization flow when a user token is expected.

3. **Scopes and Permissions:**
   - The requested scopes may only be valid for user tokens, not device tokens.

4. **Policy Issues:**
   - Conditional Access policies may restrict the use of device-only tokens.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Identify the Token Type Required:**
   - Confirm if the application/service requires a user token instead of a device-only token.

2. **Change the Authentication Flow:**
   - If a user token is needed, switch from the device authentication flow to the user authentication flow (interactive, authorization code grant).

3. **Configure the Resource:**
   - If you have control over the resource (API), check its configuration in Azure AD:
     - Register the application correctly to accept both user and device tokens.
     - Ensure the resource (API) is set up to enable user delegated permissions.

4. **Validate Application Permissions:**
   - Go to Azure AD and ensure that the application is correctly configured with API permissions that allow both user and device permissions where necessary.

5. **Use Appropriate Scopes:**
   - Ensure that the scope requested in the token request aligns with what is acceptable for user context and not just device context.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Make sure to account for any conditional access policies in your Azure AD that may impact authentication flows.
- Consider security implications when configuring resources to ensure they maintain compliance with your organizationâ€™s policies.

### Advice for Data Collection

When diagnosing the issue, it may be necessary to gather logs to understand the sequence of events leading up to the error. Here are some methods:

1. **Event Viewer Logs:**
   - Look for relevant application logs in Windows Event Viewer under the "Applications and Services Logs" (particularly under "Microsoft" and "Windows").

2. **Network Traces:**
   - Use tools like **Nettrace** to capture network activity before the error occurs, especially when making the authentication request.

3. **Fiddler:**
   - Use Fiddler to analyze HTTP(S) requests and responses involved in the authentication process to observe any rejected requests or issues with HTTP status codes.

4. **Azure AD Sign-in Logs:**
   - Review Azure AD Sign in logs to find details surrounding the failed authentication attempts associated with your application.

Following these steps and guidelines should help in effectively diagnosing and resolving the AADSTS221000 error.

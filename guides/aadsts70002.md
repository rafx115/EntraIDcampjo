2. **Expired Client Secret:** The client secret may have expired or been regenerated without updating the application.
3. **Mismatched Environments:** Client secrets generated for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) leading to authentication failures.

#### Resolution Strategies:

4. **Regenerate Credentials:**
   - If facing persistent issues, consider regenerating client credentials in the identity provider.

#### Additional Notes:

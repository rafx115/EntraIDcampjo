# AADSTS70002: InvalidClient - Error validating the credentials. The specified client_secret does not match the expected value for this client. Correct the client_secret and try again. For more info, seeUse the authorization code to request an access token.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS70002: InvalidClient Error

**Error Description**:  
AADSTS70002 indicates that there is an issue validating the credentials due to an incorrect `client_secret`. The message specifically states that the `client_secret` provided does not match the expected value for the corresponding client application.

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Review the Error Message**: Ensure you are correctly reading the error message that specifies the invalid credentials.
2. **Check Application Registration**: Verify the application registration in the Azure portal:
   - Go to the Azure Active Directory.
   - Navigate to "App registrations".
   - Locate and select the application in question.
3. **Identify Authentication Method**: Determine if you are using confidential or public client authentication. `client_secret` is only used for confidential clients.

#### Common Issues Causing This Error

1. **Incorrect Client Secret**: The most common reason is that the `client_secret` you are using is not the one configured in your Azure AD app registration.
2. **Registration Issues**: Any changes in app registration (such as regenerating the client secret) that are not updated in your application can lead to this issue.
3. **Expired Client Secret**: `client_secret` generated with an expiration date that has passed will not work.
4. **Multiple Secrets**: If multiple secrets are present, the wrong one may have been selected.
5. **Encoding Issues**: If the `client_secret` contains special characters, there could be encoding problems when sent in the request.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify Client ID and Secret**:
   - **Client ID**: Go to the application in Azure AD and confirm that the `Application (client) ID` you have in your application code matches what's in Azure.
   - **Client Secret**: Under "Certificates & secrets", check that the `client_secret` you are using matches one of the listed secrets. 
     - If necessary, copy-paste it directly to avoid typos.

2. **Regenerate Secret (If Necessary)**:
   - If you can't find the correct `client_secret`, consider regenerating a new secret:
     - In "Certificates & secrets", create a new client secret.
     - Copy the new `client_secret` immediately, as it will not be visible again.

3. **Update Application Code**:
   - Replace the old `client_secret` in your application configuration with the newly generated one.

4. **Review Configurations**:
   - Ensure that any environment variables or configuration files where the `client_secret` might be stored are correctly updated.

5. **Re-attempt Authentication**: After making the necessary changes, try to authenticate again.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Monitor for More Errors**: If this error persists after correcting the `client_secret`, monitor for other potential issues such as incorrect scopes, client IDs, or tenant IDs.
- **Security**: Do not hard-code your `client_secret` directly in your code; consider using secure methods for storing sensitive information (e.g., Azure Key Vault).
- **Environment Variables**: If using continuous deployment, ensure the correct environment variables are set for each environment.

### Advice for Data Collection
- **Log Detailed Errors**: Ensure your application logs detailed error messages for easier troubleshooting in the future.
- **Capture Request/Response**: If possible, capture the HTTP request and response that leads to the error, as this may contain useful information about what is wrong (e.g., headers, parameters).

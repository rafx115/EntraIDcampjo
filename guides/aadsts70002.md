### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS70002 - "InvalidClient"
---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify the Environment**: Determine if this error is occurring in development, staging, or production environments.
2. **Review Client Information**: Ensure you are using the correct client ID and client secret for the application in question.
3. **Check Time Synchronization**: Verify that the system clock on the server where the application resides is synchronized; OAuth relies heavily on accurate timestamps.

### Common Issues that Cause this Error

1. **Incorrect Client Secret**: The client secret being used does not match the one registered in Azure AD for the application.
2. **Expired Client Secret**: The client secret may have expired if it was set with an expiration date.
3. **Multiple App Registrations**: Potential confusion with multiple application registrations; ensure you are referencing the correct one.
4. **Environments Misconfiguration**: Using the client secret from a different environment (e.g., staging vs. production).
5. **URL Mismatch**: Incorrect redirect URIs associated with your app registration can also lead to this error.
6. **Application Permissions**: Ensure that your application has the correct permissions assigned in Azure AD.

### Step-By-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify Client Secret**:
   - Log into the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to “Azure Active Directory” > “App registrations”.
   - Locate your application and check under the “Certificates & secrets” section for the client secret.
   - Copy the client secret exactly as displayed (make sure there are no extra spaces).

2. **Confirm Client ID**:
   - Ensure the client ID you are using matches the one listed in the application registration in Azure AD.

3. **Check Expiration**:
   - If your client secret has an expiration policy, check if it has expired. If expired, create a new client secret.

4. **Inspect Application Settings**:
   - Review settings such as the redirect URIs and ensure they match the setup in Azure AD.
   - Ensure that the application is set to use the authorization code flow (if applicable).

5. **Test with Different Credentials**: 
   - Register a new application in Azure and get a new client ID and client secret. Test your application with the new credentials.

6. **Check API Permissions**:
   - Ensure your application has the necessary API permissions granted and that the permissions have been consented to for the application.

7. **Logs and Diagnostics**:
   - Use Azure's diagnostic tools to check for any logs associated with sign-in attempts. Redirect the error messages to diagnose further.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Security Best Practices**: Do not hard-code your client secret into your source code. Consider using Azure Key Vault or environment variables to manage sensitive information.
- **Revoking Secrets**: If you believe your client secret has been compromised, revoke the old secret and generate a new one.
- **Multi-Tenant Consideration**: If your application is multi-tenant, ensure that the client secret is valid for the tenant trying to authenticate.

### Documentation for Guidance

For additional guidance, the following documentation may be helpful:
- [Azure Active Directory Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios)
- [Client Credentials Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow)
- [Error Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aadsts-error-codes)

### Advice for Data Collection 

- **Event Viewer Logs**: Check the Event Viewer on the host machine for any log entries related to authentication failures or other errors.
- **Network Traces**: Use tools like `netsh trace` to collect network traces or Wireshark to analyze the traffic for any anomalies.
- **Fiddler**: Utilize Fiddler to capture HTTP/S requests and responses. This will help in observing the interaction with Azure AD and capturing the details of the requests being sent, including headers and body.

By following this detailed troubleshooting guide, you should be able to effectively diagnose and resolve the AADSTS70002 error related to invalid client validation.

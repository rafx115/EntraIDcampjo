# Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS80002 Error Code: OnPremisePasswordValidatorRequestTimedout

### Error Description:
AADSTS80002 - OnPremisePasswordValidatorRequestTimedout: Password validation request timed out. Make sure that Active Directory is available and responding to requests from the agents.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Check Network Connectivity**: Ensure that the machine where the agent is running has proper network connectivity to communicate with the Active Directory server.
   
2. **Active Directory Availability**: Verify if the Active Directory service is up and running without any issues.

3. **Review Error Logs**: Look at the event logs on both the machine where the agent is installed and the Active Directory server to identify any relevant error messages.

### Common Issues:
- Slow Network Speeds: Slow network connectivity can cause the password validation request to timeout.
- Active Directory Service Interruption: If the Active Directory service is not available or experiencing issues, the password validation request may fail.
- Firewall Restrictions: Network firewalls or security settings may be blocking communication between the agent and Active Directory.

### Step-by-step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Restart Services**: Restart the Active Directory service and the agent service to refresh the connections.
   
2. **Check Firewall Settings**: Ensure that the necessary ports for communication between the agent and Active Directory are open and not restricted by any firewall rules.

3. **Increase Timeout Limits**: If the timeout setting is too short, consider increasing it to allow sufficient time for the password validation request to complete.

4. **Network Troubleshooting**: Perform network diagnostics to identify any connectivity issues that could be causing the timeout.

5. **Update Agent Software**: Make sure you are using the latest version of the agent software, as newer versions may have bug fixes or improvements related to this issue.

### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- **Permission Requirements**: Ensure that the user account running the agent has the necessary permissions to communicate with Active Directory.
- **Rerun Validation Request**: If the issue persists, try re-running the password validation request after implementing the resolution steps.

### Documentation:
- Microsoft's official documentation on [Troubleshooting Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-to-troubleshoot-azure-active-directory) can provide additional guidance on resolving issues related to Azure AD error codes.

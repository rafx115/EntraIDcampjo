# AADSTS80002: OnPremisePasswordValidatorRequestTimedout - Password validation request timed out. Make sure that Active Directory is available and responding to requests from the agents.


## Troubleshooting Steps
### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS80002 Error

**Error Description:**
Error Code: AADSTS80002  
Description: OnPremisePasswordValidatorRequestTimedout - Password validation request timed out. Make sure that Active Directory is available and responding to requests from the agents.

#### 1. Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check for Service Outages:**
   - Verify if there are any ongoing service outages or incidents by checking the official Azure Service Health dashboard.

2. **Validate Network Connectivity:**
   - Ensure that the network connection between Azure AD and your on-premises Active Directory (AD) is functioning properly.
   - Check for any firewall rules or network configurations that might block traffic.

3. **Review the Azure AD Connect configuration:**
   - Check if Azure AD Connect is healthy and running without errors. 

4. **Test Password Validation:**
   - Run a simple test to validate if you can authenticate with an on-premises account directly against AD outside of Azure. Use tools like `nltest`.

#### 2. Common Issues that Cause this Error

1. **Network Issues:**
   - Intermittent network connectivity issues can lead to request timeouts.

2. **Active Directory Performance:**
   - High load on the AD server or issues with the AD database can delay responses.

3. **Azure AD Connect Configuration:**
   - Misconfigurations in Azure AD Connect setups, especially in the Password Synchronization or Writeback features.

4. **Firewall and Security Settings:**
   - Firewall rules that incorrectly block necessary ports or protocols required for AD communication.

5. **DNS Issues:**
   - Incorrect DNS entries that prevent Azure from resolving the domain controllers.

6. **Agent Issues:**
   - Issues with the Azure AD Connect agent (like it being offline or misconfigured).

#### 3. Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Verify Active Directory Reachability:**
   - Use `ping` and `nslookup` commands to ensure that the Azure AD Connect server can reach the on-premises AD DS servers.

2. **Check Azure AD Connect Health:**
   - Open the Azure AD Connect Health portal.
   - Ensure the synchronization services show as "running" and look for any alerts or warnings.

3. **Review Server Logs:**
   - Check the Event Viewer logs on the Azure AD Connect server for any warnings or errors related to synchronization or network issues.
     - Look under **Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Azure AD Connect**.

4. **Restart the Azure AD Connect Services:**
   - Restart the Microsoft Azure AD Sync service on the server.

5. **Review Firewall Settings:**
   - Ensure that the necessary ports for LDAP (usually 389 for non-secure and 636 for secure) and Kerberos (88) are open.

6. **Monitor Active Directory Performance:**
   - Use Performance Monitor to evaluate Active Directory performance and check for high CPU or memory usage.

7. **Confirm DNS Configuration:**
   - Ensure that your Azure AD Connect server can properly resolve the domain controllers.
   - Update any erroneous DNS settings as necessary.

8. **Use Fiddler/Wireshark:**
   - If applicable, use Fiddler or Wireshark to capture and monitor the network traffic during the password validation attempt.
   - Look for anomalies or blocked requests in the traffic logs.

#### 4. Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Time Synchronization:** Ensure that both the Azure AD Connect machine and your AD domain controllers are time-synchronized with a reliable NTP server.
- **Secret Management:** On rare occasions, updates in policies or secrets used for authentication can affect connectivity.
- **Load Balancing:** If using multiple domain controllers, ensure that all are operational and properly integrated.

#### 6. Advice for Data Collection

- **Event Viewer Logs:**
  - Collect logs from the Event Viewer on the Azure AD Connect server, especially under the Azure AD Connect section.
  
- **Network Tracing:**
  - Use `nettrace` command-line tool for network tracing if applicable.
  
- **Fiddler Setup:**
  - If using Fiddler, ensure that it is configured to capture traffic both from and to the Azure services.

- **Capture Relevant Logs:**
  - Create a detailed log collection plan to gather necessary logs (Event Viewer, Azure AD Connect logs, Fiddler captures) for further analysis.

By following this guide, you should be able to systematically diagnose and resolve the AADSTS80002 error while ensuring a proper and well-performing connection to Active Directory.

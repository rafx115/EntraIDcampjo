# AADSTS80002: OnPremisePasswordValidatorRequestTimedout - Password validation request timed out. Make sure that Active Directory is available and responding to requests from the agents.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! Here's a detailed troubleshooting guide for the error code AADSTS80002, specifically the "OnPremisePasswordValidatorRequestTimedout" which indicates that a password validation request from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to an on-premises Active Directory has timed out.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify Scope & Impact**: Determine if this issue is affecting all users or specific individuals. Check if it's occurring in specific applications or across all applications utilizing Azure AD for authentication.

2. **Check Timeouts**: Verify if the timeout is consistently occurring or if it's intermittent. This could assist in identifying if it's a transient issue or a configuration problem.

3. **Review Event Logs**: Look at the event logs on the servers running Azure AD Connect or any other related services to see if there are any error messages around the time the issue occurred.

4. **Network Connectivity**: Ensure that the network connections between Azure AD services and your on-premise Active Directory are functioning properly. This includes checking VPNs, firewalls, and any proxies that may affect communication.

### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **Network Issues**: Connectivity problems between the Azure AD services and the on-premises Active Directory, such as DNS resolution issues, blocked ports, or VPN failures.

2. **On-Premise Active Directory Availability**: The Active Directory might be down or under heavy load, causing delays in responding to validation requests.

3. **AD FS Configuration Issues**: If you're using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), misconfigurations might cause timeouts when validating passwords against the on-premises directory.

4. **Service Outages**: Temporary service outages in Azure AD or Azure services that might be causing the requests to time out.

5. **Firewall or Proxy Settings**: Firewall rules or proxy settings could be blocking the outbound requests to Azure AD.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Check Active Directory Health**:
   - Use tools like `dcdiag` on your domain controller to check the health of the Active Directory environment.
   - Check for any replication issues with `repadmin`.

2. **Validate Network Connectivity**:
   - Use `ping` and `tracert` to test connectivity from your on-premises environment to Azure AD services.
   - Ensure that important endpoints (like those used by Azure AD Connect) are accessible.

3. **Monitor AD Performance**:
   - Review the performance metrics on your Active Directory servers to check if they are under high load or affected by resource constraints.

4. **Review Azure AD Connect Status**:
   - Check if Azure AD Connect is functioning (use the Synchronization Service Manager).
   - Review the Azure AD Connect logs for any error messages.

5. **Enable Detailed Logging**:
   - If not already enabled, consider turning on detailed logging for Azure AD Connect to capture more detailed error information.

6. **Adjust Timeout Settings**:
   - In some scenarios, increasing the timeout settings for password validation requests might help.
   - Check the configurations in Azure AD Connect for timeout settings related to password validation.

7. **Test with Different Credentials**:
   - Attempt password validation with different user accounts to ensure the issue isnâ€™t localized to a specific user.

8. **Reboot Services**:
   - If feasible, restart the Azure AD Connect service, the accompanying server, or any network devices that may affect performance.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Regularly monitor the health and performance of both Azure AD and on-premises Active Directory.
- Consider scaling up resources if your AD environment is under heavy load or particularly busy.
- Implement logging and monitoring solutions that can alert you to issues as they arise.

### Advice for Data Collection

- Collect logs from your Active Directory servers, servers running Azure AD Connect, and any related infrastructure.
- Gather network performance logs during the time the issues occurred to identify any connectivity issues.
- If using AD FS, collect relevant AD FS logs for further diagnostics.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and address the root causes of the AADSTS80002 error effectively.

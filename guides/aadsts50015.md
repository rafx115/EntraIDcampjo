# AADSTS50015: ViralUserLegalAgeConsentRequiredState - The user requires legal age group consent.


## Troubleshooting Steps
The error code AADSTS50015 with the description "ViralUserLegalAgeConsentRequiredState - The user requires legal age group consent" usually indicates that an Azure Active Directory (AAD) user is in a legal age group that necessitates parental or guardian consent before they can use certain applications or services.

Here is a detailed troubleshooting guide:

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Verify User Details**:
   - Obtain the user’s profile information to view their date of birth (DOB) and legal status.
   - Check if the user is a minor based on the applicable laws in their region.

2. **Understand the Application Requirements**:
   - Identify which application the user is trying to access and if that application necessitates legal age consent.

3. **Review Azure AD Settings**:
   - Examine the Azure Active Directory tenant settings related to age verification and consent.

4. **Check Indian User's Consent Settings**:
   - If applicable, ensure that the user’s account is set up correctly in regard to consent parameters.

### Common Issues that Cause this Error

1. **Age Below Legal Requirements**:
   - The user might be under the age designated by local laws as requiring parental or guardian consent.

2. **Missing Consent**:
   - The application might have been set to require consent, and it hasn't been granted yet.

3. **Incorrect User Attributes**:
   - The user’s attributes in AAD (like date of birth, etc.) may be missing or incorrectly set, causing their age to be improperly evaluated.

4. **Policy Restrictions**:
   - Organization-wide policies may impose restrictions that require consent for certain applications based on user age status.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Check User Age Attributes**:
   - Navigate to Azure Active Directory → Users → [User] → Profile.
   - Confirm the user’s date of birth and make sure it is entered correctly.

2. **Gather Parental Consent (If Required)**:
   - If the user is underage, inform the guardian or parent about the process to give consent.
   - Depending on organizational policy, a form or system may be in place for submitting this consent.

3. **Modify User Details**:
   - If the user’s age results in them needing consent, and if appropriate, update their birthdate or legal status in AAD.

4. **Application Configuration**:
   - Check the application registration in Azure AD to see if age restrictions can be configured.
   - Modify permissions if the application does not need to enforce these checks.

5. **Test After Changes**:
   - After any updates, have the user attempt to log in to the application again. Monitor for resolution of the error.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure that all changes comply with local laws and regulations regarding data protection and parental consent.
- **User Impact**: Be aware that these settings may also impact other services the user has access to, so any changes should be documented for future reference.

### Documentation References

- **Azure Active Directory Documentation**: Explore Microsoft’s official documentation on managing user attributes and consent settings.

### Advice for Data Collection

In case additional investigation is required, here are methods to collect data:

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Check relevant logs in Windows Event Viewer under 'Applications and Services Logs' → 'Microsoft' → 'Windows' → 'AzureAD' for specific error codes or warnings around the time the issue occurred.

2. **Network Trace with Nettrace**:
   - Use `Netsh trace start capture` to initiate network tracing before the user attempts to access the service, capturing pertinent network requests.

3. **Fiddler for HTTP Debugging**:
   - Start Fiddler before the user replicates the error to capture HTTP requests and responses, allowing you to analyze any API calls made to the Azure AD service.

By following the above troubleshooting guide, you should be able to identify and remedy the issue associated with the AADSTS50015 error code effectively.

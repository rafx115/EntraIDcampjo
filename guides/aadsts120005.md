## Troubleshooting Steps
## Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS120005 Error: "PasswordChangeOnPremSuccessCloudFail"

### Overview
The error code AADSTS120005 indicates a failure when attempting to sync a password change from an on-premises Active Directory (AD) to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) while the change was successfully processed on-premises. This can happen frequently in environments that extend AD functions to the cloud via Azure AD Connect.

### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Check User Account Status**: Verify that the affected user account is active, not locked out, and not disabled in Active Directory.
  
2. **Service Status**: Confirm that Azure AD services are running and check the Azure status page for any reported outages or service issues.

3. **Health of Azure AD Connect**: Check the health and status of Azure AD Connect. Ensure the synchronization service is running without errors.

4. **Review Password Synchronization Settings**: Ensure that the password synchronization feature is correctly configured in Azure AD Connect.

5. **Check for Sync Errors**: Use the Azure AD Connect Synchronization Service Manager to check for any synchronization errors related to the user or service.

### Common Issues that Cause AADSTS120005
1. **Password Hash Synchronization Disabled**: If password hash synchronization is not enabled, Azure AD will not receive the new password.

2. **AD Connect Configuration Errors**: Misconfiguration or corrupted settings within Azure AD Connect can lead to failures in password changes.

3. **Connectivity Issues**: Network problems might prevent Azure AD from receiving updated passwords.

4. **User Principal Name (UPN) Mismatch**: If there is a mismatch between the on-premises UPN and the Azure AD UPN, issues can arise.

5. **Replication Issues**: Delays in on-premises AD replication may cause the password not to update in Azure AD immediately.

6. **Account Not Found in Azure AD**: The user account may not have successfully been synchronized to Azure AD.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Verify Password Synchronization Setting**:
   - Open Azure AD Connect and check if Password Hash Synchronization is enabled. If not, enable it.

2. **Check Azure AD Connect Health**:
   - Access Azure AD Connect Health and identify any alerts related to password sync.
   - Make necessary adjustments or resolve any observed issues.

3. **Review Azure AD Sign-In Logs**:
   - Go to Azure AD in the Azure portal.
   - Review the sign-in logs to identify any additional error details related to the user's password change attempt.

4. **Recheck User's Azure AD UPN**:
   - Ensure the UPN in AD matches the UPN in Azure AD.
   - If thereâ€™s a mismatch, either change the UPN in AD or update Azure AD accordingly.

5. **Test Password Synchronization Manually**:
   - Use the "Test-ADSyncClient" cmdlet in PowerShell to troubleshoot sync errors on specific accounts.

6. **Reset User Password**:
   - If needed, reset the user's password manually in the on-premises AD and verify if it synchronizes after resetting.

7. **Check Network Connectivity**:
   - Confirm that there are no firewall rules or network issues that may prevent Azure AD Connect from accessing Azure AD.

8. **Contact Support**:
   - If the issue persists, consider contacting Microsoft support for further assistance.

### Additional Notes or Considerations
- **Change Management**: Ensure documentation is maintained for change management procedures to avoid disrupting password synchronization.
- **Regular Monitoring**: Regularly monitor Azure AD Connect health and review logs for early detection of potential issues.
- **Testing Environment**: If possible, use a testing environment to try out changes before applying them to production.

### Advice for Data Collection (Event Viewer, Nettrace, Fiddler)
- **Event Viewer**: Check for events related to Azure AD Connect and the password synchronization process. Look for specific errors under "Applications and Services Logs" -> "Microsoft" -> "AzureAD" or "Microsoft Azure AD Sync".

- **NetTrace**: Use a network trace tool to monitor network traffic related to Azure AD requests during a password change operation. This can help identify connectivity issues.

- **Fiddler**: You can use Fiddler to capture HTTP(S) requests from Azure AD Connect during the password sync process, which may provide insight into errors or failed requests to Azure AD.

By following this troubleshooting guide, you should be able to identify and resolve issues associated with the AADSTS120005 error effectively.

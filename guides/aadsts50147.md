**Troubleshooting Guide for Error Code AADSTS50147: MissingCodeChallenge**

**Initial Diagnostic Steps:**

1. Verify the error message: Ensure that the error code AADSTS50147 is indeed
   related to a MissingCodeChallenge parameter that is not valid.
2. Check the environment: Confirm the platform or application where the error
   occurred (Azure Active Directory, OAuth 2.0 authentication, etc.).
3. Review recent changes: Identify any recent updates, configurations, or
   changes that might have triggered the error.

**Common Issues causing this error:**

1. Incorrect size/format of the code challenge parameter.
2. Mismatch between the generation and validation of the code challenge.
3. Encoding/decoding issues related to the code challenge.
4. App registration misconfigurations in Azure AD.

**Step-by-step Resolution Strategies:**

1. **Verify Code Challenge Parameter:**

   * Check the length and format requirements for the code challenge.
   * Ensure that the code challenge is correctly generated and transmitted.
   * Review any encoding/decoding processes to confirm data integrity.

2. **App Registration Settings:**

   * Navigate to Azure Portal and find the registered application causing the
     error.
   * Check the authentication settings and make sure the code challenge method
     matches the validation method.
   * If necessary, update the app registration with the correct code challenge
     settings.

3. **Clear Cache and Cookies:**

   * Clear the browser cache and cookies to eliminate any stored invalid code
     challenge data.
   * Restart the browser and attempt the authentication process again to see if
     the error persists.

4. **Debugging Tools:**

   * Use debugging tools like Fiddler or browser developer tools to inspect the
     requests/responses during the authentication flow.
   * Look for any anomalies in the code challenge parameter handling.

5. **Consult Azure AD Documentation:**
   * Refer to official Azure AD and OAuth 2.0 documentation for best practices
     on handling code challenges.
   * Compare your implementation with the recommended guidelines to identify
     discrepancies.

**Additional Notes or Considerations:**

* Keep track of any error patterns or frequency to help isolate the root cause.
* Engage with relevant technical support forums or communities for insights from

# AADSTS50147: MissingCodeChallenge - The size of the code challenge parameter isn't valid.


## Troubleshooting Steps
Certainly! The error code AADSTS50147 indicates an issue with the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow, specifically regarding the `code_challenge` parameter. The key part of the error description, "MissingCodeChallenge - The size of the code challenge parameter isn't valid," suggests a problem with the format or length of the `code_challenge`.

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Validation of Request Parameters**
   - Verify that the `code_challenge` parameter is being sent in the authorization request.
   - Confirm that its size conforms to the expected length (base64url encoded lengths).

2. **Check PKCE Requirements**
   - Ensure that the client application is correctly implementing the PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) extension.

3. **Review Application Configuration**
   - Validate the application settings in Azure AD, including the client ID, redirect URIs, and any settings related to authorization.

4. **Monitor User Experience**
   - Determine if the issue occurs consistently for all users or is isolated to specific cases.

#### Common Issues that Cause this Error

- **Invalid Length of Code Challenge**: The `code_challenge` must be a valid Base64 URL-encoded SHA-256 hash of the `code_verifier`. If the size is off, this error occurs.
- **Misconfiguration in Azure AD**: Incorrect settings or missing permissions when registering the application can also lead to issues.
- **Improper Implementation of PKCE**: Lack of proper integration of PKCE in the client app can result in this error.
- **Generic Issues with HTTP Request**: Check for issues with how the HTTP request is constructed, including URL encoding problems.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Validate the Code Challenge:**
   - Confirm that your `code_verifier` meets the requirements (between 43 and 128 characters).
   - Verify that the `code_challenge` is derived from the `code_verifier` using the correct method (SHA-256) and is then Base64 URL-encoded.
   - Example of generating `code_challenge` in Python:
     ```python
     import hashlib
     import base64
     
     code_verifier = "your_code_verifier"
     code_challenge = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(hashlib.sha256(code_verifier.encode()).digest()).decode().rstrip("=")
     ```

2. **Audit Azure AD Application Registration:**
   - Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to your app registration.
   - Check the redirect URIs and ensure they match what is being used in your application.

3. **Review Application Dependencies:**
   - Make sure that all libraries and SDKs used for handling OAuth are up to date and that no bugs are present in the versions being used.

4. **Test for Consistency:**
   - Test the application with varied conditions (different clients, different browsers) to see if the error persists.

5. **Implement Logging:**
   - Add detailed logging around the OAuth flow to capture the exact parameters being sent and received.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations

- *Update Libraries*: If you are using third-party libraries for OAuth, ensure they are up to date as issues can sometimes occur in older versions.

- *Consult Documentation*: The implementation must adhere to the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect specifications. Ensure adherence to those standards.

#### Documentation for Reference

- [Azure AD OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc)
- [PKCE for OAuth 2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636)

#### Advice for Data Collection

- **Event Viewer Logs**: Look for application errors or failed request logs around the time the error occurs.
  
- **Network Tracing with Fiddler/NetTrace**: Capture the network traffic to observe the full HTTP request/response cycle:
  - Include all parameters being sent in the authorization request.
  - Verify that the `code_challenge` parameter appears correctly formatted.

By following the above strategies, you can methodically address the error AADSTS50147 and ensure the proper operation of your authentication flow.

---

### Initial Diagnostic Steps

1. **Confirm User Identity**: Ensure that the user experiencing the issue is using correct credentials. Verify their account status in Azure Active Directory (AAD).
   
2. **Check Service Status**: Check the Azure status page to see if there are any ongoing issues with Azure AD or related services.

3. **Review Access Policies**: Verify any Conditional Access policies that apply to the user or the application they are trying to access.

4. **Check Device State**: Ensure that the Windows device meets the requirements for compliance based on Conditional Access policies.

5. **Authenticate with Different User/Device**: If possible, test the authentication with a different user account or device to determine if the issue is user or device-specific.

### Common Issues that Cause This Error

1. **Device Compliance**: The device does not meet Conditional Access requirements (like MDM enrollment or OS version).

2. **Suspicious Activity**: The sign-in attempt was flagged due to suspicious behavior, possibly from unfamiliar IP addresses or geolocation.

3. **Access Policies**: Conditional Access policies in place that block access based on certain criteria (location, user group, application, etc.).

4. **Security Policies**: Additional security measures (like MFA) not being fulfilled during login.

5. **Expired Sessions or Tokens**: Previous sessions may not have been properly terminated causing a session carry-over.

### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies

1. **Assess and Update Device Compliance**:
   - Ensure that the Windows device is compliant with your organization’s policies. Check for required configurations like encryption, up-to-date OS, and installation of management profiles.
   - Run a compliance check through your Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution.

2. **Review Conditional Access Policies**:
   - Log into Azure Portal.
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Conditional Access** > **Policies**.
   - Check if any policies explicitly block access for the specific user or application in question. Modify if necessary.

3. **Investigate User Sign-in Risk**:
   - Access the **Sign-ins** log within Azure AD.
   - Check for sign-in logs that indicate ‘risk detected’ or any similar messages and respond based on those findings.

4. **Review Security Configuration**:
   - Inspect any MFA policies and ensure that the user has completed all necessary authentication steps.
   - Confirm that they are using trusted networks.

5. **Clear Sessions or Reset Credentials**:
   - If there is suspicion of an expired session or token issues, ask the user to log out completely, clear all cookies, or try using Incognito/Private Browsing mode.
   - Reset the user’s password as a last resort.

### Additional Notes or Considerations

- Make sure to communicate with users regarding potential authentication delays due to policy evaluations.
- Assess if any recent changes were made to the IT environment that may have triggered stricter security policies.
- Ensure that your Azure AD license allows for the required Conditional Access features.

### Advice for Data Collection

1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - For Windows, check under `Windows Logs` > `Application` for any error messages related to user authentication.
  
2. **NetTrace**:
   - Use the Network Tracing tool to analyze network traffic during the sign-in phase to examine failed requests and responses.

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Use Fiddler to capture the traffic from the application being accessed. Filter to see authentication-related URLs, which may help in diagnosing the request that led to the error.

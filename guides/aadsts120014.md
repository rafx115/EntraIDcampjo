### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS120014: "PasswordChangeOnPremUserAccountLockedOutOrDisabled"

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps:
1. **Confirm Error Context**:
   - Identify under what circumstances the error occurs. This could be during user login attempts, password changes, or other services that rely on the user's identity.

2. **User Verification**:
   - Confirm the affected user ID/account by checking if the same user is encountering the error consistently.

3. **Check Account Status**:
   - Determine if the user account is locked out or disabled within the on-premises Active Directory (AD).

4. **Review Logs**:
   - Review Azure AD sign-in logs or any related logs in your identity management system to capture any specific error messages or context.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error:
1. **Locked Out Accounts**:
   - The user's on-premises Active Directory account is locked out due to multiple failed login attempts.

2. **Disabled Accounts**:
   - The userâ€™s account in the on-premises Active Directory is disabled.

3. **Password Expiration**:
   - The user's password might have expired, requiring an update.

4. **Replication Issues**:
   - If Azure AD Connect is used, replication issues between on-premises AD and Azure AD might cause this error.

5. **Authentication Methods**:
   - Incorrect setup of multi-factor authentication or other authentication methods may lead to issues if the account is locked or disabled.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:
1. **Unlock the User Account**:
   - For a locked-out account:
     - Log into your Active Directory server.
     - Open the **Active Directory Users and Computers** console.
     - Locate the user account, right-click, and select **Unlock Account**.

2. **Enable the User Account**:
   - For a disabled account:
     - In the **Active Directory Users and Computers** console, right-click the user account and select **Enable Account**.

3. **Reset User Password**:
   - If the password has expired:
     - Reset the password using the **Active Directory Users and Computers** tool and ensure it meets your organization's password policy.

4. **Check for Replication Issues**:
   - Ensure that your Azure AD Connect service is healthy and synchronized properly. Use the **Azure AD Connect Health** for monitoring replication status.

5. **Review Conditional Access Policies**:
   - If applicable, review any conditional access policies that might affect the user login experience, ensuring they are working as intended.

6. **Provide User Guidance**:
   - If the user had recent changes, provide guidance on necessary steps to log in or reset their password.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations:
- Ensure that you have sufficient permissions to unlock accounts and reset passwords within Active Directory.
- Be aware of organizational security policies regarding account lockouts and password resets.
- Regularly review the configured password policies to prevent user accounts from being locked out unnecessarily.

#### Documentation for Guidance:
- Microsoft Documentation on Azure Active Directory Authentication Errors:
   - [Troubleshoot Azure Active Directory sign-in issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-troubleshoot-sign-in)
   - [Managing user accounts inAD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/ad-ds-admin-roles)

#### Advice for Data Collection:
1. **Event Viewer Logs**:
   - Check the **Windows Event Viewer** on your domain controller for any warnings or errors under:
     - **Windows Logs** > **Security** for failed login attempts.
     - **Application and Services Logs** > **Directory Service** for replication errors.

2. **Network Traces**:
   - Use **Netsh trace** to capture network traces during the authentication attempt which may help in identifying network-related issues.
   - Command: `netsh trace start capture=yes` and `netsh trace stop`

3. **Fiddler**:
   - Set up **Fiddler** to monitor HTTP/HTTPS traffic if the issue involves web authentication flows. Check for any failed requests and corresponding statuses.

4. **Azure AD Logs**:
   - Review Azure AD sign-in logs via the Azure portal to analyze the error events and gather more context on the direct cause of the error.

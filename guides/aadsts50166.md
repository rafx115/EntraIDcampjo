#### **Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies:**
1. **Check Throttling Policies:**
   - Contact the claims provider to verify if they have any throttling policies in place and ensure you are not hitting those limits.
   - If throttling is the issue, work with the provider to adjust the limits or optimize your request frequency.

2. **Network Connectivity:**
   - Verify if there are any network issues by checking for firewall rules that might be blocking requests to/from the claims provider.
   - Test network connectivity by pinging the claims provider's endpoint to ensure there are no connection problems.

3. **Configuration Validation:**
   - Double-check the configuration settings for the claims provider in Azure AD to ensure they are accurate and up to date.
   - Verify that the claims provider endpoint URLs, authentication methods, and any required parameters are correctly configured.

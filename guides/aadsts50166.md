# AADSTS50166: ExternalClaimsProviderThrottled - Failed to send the request to the claims provider.


## Troubleshooting Steps
The error code AADSTS50166 indicates that the request to an external claims provider was not processed due to throttling issues. This typically means that the claims provider is either too busy or there are too many requests being sent in a short period, causing it to reject additional requests.

### Troubleshooting Guide for AADSTS50166

#### Initial Diagnostic Steps
1. **Check the Error Message**: Confirm that the error message is precisely "ExternalClaimsProviderThrottled - Failed to send the request to the claims provider." This can help in narrowing down the issue.
   
2. **Identify the Claims Provider**: Determine which external claims provider is causing the issue. This could be a third-party identity provider or a custom claims provider you've configured.

3. **Analyze Trend in Requests**: Look for spikes in authentication requests around the time the error occurred. This can indicate whether throttling is due to a sudden increase in logins.

4. **Review User Behavior**: If the issue is user-specific, gather data on the patterns of the affected users. Behavioral factors like multiple failed login attempts or bot-like behavior could be a contributing factor.

#### Common Issues that Cause This Error
- **Increased Authentication Requests**: An upsurge in requests from users, applications, or services can trigger throttling.
  
- **Claims Provider Configuration**: Misconfigurations in the external claims provider may lead to performance issues.
  
- **Performance Issues on Claims Provider Side**: The claims provider may be experiencing its own performance problems, such as high load or downtime.

- **Network Issues**: Temporary network issues or latencies affecting communication with the claims provider may lead to failed requests.

#### Step-by-Step Resolution Strategies
1. **Monitor Claims Provider Performance**:
   - Check for service health and performance metrics on the claims provider's dashboard or management console.

2. **Adjust Throttling Limits**:
   - If possible, request or configure increased throttling limits. Consult the documentation of the claims provider for guidance on increasing throughput.

3. **Implement Retry Logic**:
   - Update your application to implement an exponential backoff retry strategy when encountering throttling errors. This allows your application to wait and retry requests periodically rather than overwhelming the provider.

4. **Update Claims Provider Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the claims provider configuration in Azure AD is accurate. Check for correctly set endpoints, client ID, and secrets.

5. **Connection Optimization**:
   - Optimize how the application communicates with the claims provider. For instance, minimizing the number of requests by consolidating them or caching tokens can help.

6. **User Load Management**:
   - Consider implementing rate limiting on user authentication requests. You can spread out requests from different users or applications to alleviate spikes.

7. **Check Network Configuration**:
   - Ensure there are no firewall rules or network issues that may be intermittently affecting the connection to the claims provider.

#### Additional Notes or Considerations
- Ensure you have access to monitor both Azure AD and your external claims provider for integrated troubleshooting.
- Keep communication open with the claims provider's support team to help understand any ongoing issues on their end.

#### Documentation for Guidance
- Documentation for Azure Active Directory throttling limits can be found here:
  - [Azure AD Throttling Limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-throttling-limits)
  
- Claims provider configuration documentation specific to your third-party provider.

#### Advice for Data Collection
- **Event Viewer**: Collect logs from the Event Viewer, specifically under the Application and System logs, to see any warnings or errors related to authentication attempts.
  
- **Network Tracing**: Use tools like NetTrace or Fiddler to capture HTTP traffic between your application and the claims provider. Look for failed requests, timeouts, or responses indicating throttling.

- **Application Logs**: Ensure your application has adequate logging to capture authentication failures and the reasons for those failures for further analysis.

By following this guide, you should be able to identify and resolve issues related to the AADSTS50166 error code effectively.
